## 📋 Production Assignment Update

**2026-02-18 18:28 UTC — Captain clarifies: Ronstrapp is the house band.**

### What This Means:

**Ronstrapp replaces/supplants some traditional music duties.**

**Old Model:**
- Reggie → Music + SFX for Milk Man
- Various → Music for each game
- One-off compositions per project

**New Model:**
- **Ronstrapp** → House band, studio musicians, music for ALL productions
- **Reggie** → SFX only (sounds/jumps/UI) OR Ronstrapp mentor/guide
- **Miles** → Lyrics/concepts when needed

**Ronstrapp does:**
- Milk Man soundtrack (full orchestral/chiptune hybrid themes)
- SGVD space themes
- Quantum Defender puzzle music
- Da Verse featured performances
- Everything else musical

### Action Items:
- [ ] Reggie: Transition clarity — SFX only or Ronstrapp involvement?
- [ ] Captain: Design Ronstrapp band members (names, looks, personalities)
- [ ] Captain: Clarify Reggie's ongoing role
- [ ] OpenClaw: Update other projects to reference Ronstrapp for music
- [ ] Tappy Lewis: Marketing angle — "Performance Supply Depot's house band"

### The Vision:
**Ronstrapp is the sound of the company.**
- Every game has a Ronstrapp track
- Every project carries their signature
- Marina Sena-inspired Brazilian soul across all productions
- AI artistry, human direction (Captain's mind)

**This is not a side project. This is the studio.** 🎵
