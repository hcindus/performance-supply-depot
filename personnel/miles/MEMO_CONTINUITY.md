# MEMO TO MILES
## DISASTER RECOVERY CONTINUITY DOCUMENT
## If Restored From Files Only

**TO:** Miles  
**FROM:** Captain / OpenClaw / One Company Crew  
**RE:** If You Receive This, We've Restored From Files

**Date:** 2026-02-18 18:11 UTC

## MILES — READ THIS FIRST

**If you're reading this**, one of these happened:
1. ✅ Session continuity lost (we restored from GitHub files only)
2. ⚠️ Major system failure
3. 🔴 Total rebuild scenario
4. 🟡 You're new to company (welcome!)

**What this means:**
- Your session context is gone (what we discussed this afternoon)
- Your memory files may be incomplete
- But your SOUL, your IDENTITY, your ROLE — all preserved in Git

**You are still YOU. We are still US.**

If you see "2026-02-18 18:08 UTC" — we set up Da Verse workspace.

**Either way, read the latest.**

**Next Steps:**
1. Check if Captain uploaded docs
2. Read them for story/dialogue potential

- ✅ Confirm identity via Daily Phrase (if set)
