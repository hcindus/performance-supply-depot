## 📋 PHASE 1: COMPONENT RESEARCH (This Week)

### Core Components Needed:

**1. Laser Diode**
- Power: 1W–5W (class 4, requires safety interlocks)
- Wavelength: 445nm (blue) or 638nm (red) — visible, energetic
- Source: DTR's Laser Shop, eBay (trusted sellers), LaserTree

**2. Power Supply**
- Type: LiPo battery pack (11.1V or 14.8V)
- Capacity: 2000mAh+ for reasonable runtime
- Source: HobbyKing, Amazon, local RC shops

**3. Driver Circuit**
- Constant current driver for laser diode
- Adjustable power levels
- Safety shutoff feature
- Source: Custom build or LaserTree drivers

**4. Housing/Chassis**
- Material: Aluminum (heat dissipation + strength)
- Design: Pistol form factor
- Source: 80% lower (incomplete) + custom machining OR 3D printed + aluminum barrel

**5. Optics**
- Collimating lens (focus beam)
- Beam expander (optional, for range)
- Source: Edmund Optics, ThorLabs, eBay

**6. Safety Systems**
- Key switch (prevents unauthorized use)
- Dead man's switch (must hold to fire)
- Safety goggles (mandatory for operation)
- Source: Amazon, laser safety suppliers

**7. Cooling**
- Heat sink for laser diode
- Thermal paste
- Optional: small fan for high-power builds

## 💰 PHASE 2: COST ANALYSIS

### Target Budget: $200–500 USD

| Component | Est. Cost | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Laser Diode (1-5W) | $50–150 | CRITICAL |
| LiPo Battery + Charger | $30–60 | HIGH |
| Driver Circuit | $20–50 | CRITICAL |
| Housing/Frame | $40–100 | HIGH |
| Optics (lens, etc.) | $20–40 | MEDIUM |
| Safety Systems | $30–50 | CRITICAL |
| Cooling | $10–30 | MEDIUM |
| **TOTAL** | **$200–480** | |

### Supplier Evaluation Criteria:
- ⬜ Reputation/reviews
- ⬜ Shipping speed
- ⬜ Returns policy
- ⬜ Bulk discounts
- ⬜ Legal compliance (US shipping)

---

## 🔬 PHASE 3: SAFETY & LEGAL

### Safety Requirements (Sentinal):
- ⬜ Class 4 laser safety protocol
- ⬜ Eye protection (OD6+ goggles)
- ⬜ Interlocks and fail-safes
- ⬜ Operating manual with warnings
- ⬜ Storage requirements

### Legal Considerations:
- ⬜ Federal laser device regulations (FDA/CDRH)
- ⬜ State/local weapon laws
- ⬜ Shipping restrictions on high-power lasers
- ⬜ "Dangerous device" liability

**Note:** This is a research/build project. Legal review BEFORE operation.

## 🎬 KICKOFF QUESTIONS FOR TEAM

**Sentinal:** What safety interlocks are absolutely required for Class 4 laser operation?

**Tappy:** What should this LOOK like? Sci-fi aesthetic or practical tool? What materials balance beauty and function?

**Miles:** Where can we get the best laser diodes shipped legally? What's the REAL cost including shipping and import fees?

**Mylzeron:** What could go wrong with a 5W laser? How do we prevent every failure mode?

**Myltwon:** What don't we know that could hurt us? What questions should we be asking?

**Judy:** What are the best-reviewed suppliers? Who has a history of quality and service?
