## COLD OPEN

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

A typical 1950s schoolyard. Children play, laugh, eat LUNCH.

**TEACHER**  
Alright class, time for lunch! Form the milk line!

Children line up, receiving MILK CARTONS and LUNCHES.

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
*(narrating)*  
Dairyopolis Elementary. Where every child gets their daily calcium.

### INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

Children sit at tables, eating. Sandwiches. Apple slices. MILK.

Then —

A GREEN LIGHT sweeps through the cafeteria.

**KID #1**  
Hey! My milk turned GREEN!

**KID #2**  
Ew! My cheese is FUZZY!

**KID #3**  
MY LUNCH IS MOVING!

The FOOD IS SPOILING. Rapidly. MILK turns to CURDS to MOLD. Cheese grows FUZZY. Bread turns GREEN.

Children SCREAM and RUN.

---

## ACT ONE: THE MOLD QUEEN

### EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Standing on the school: **SPOILINA** — the Mold Queen.

She's draped in fuzzy, FERMENTING ROBES. Her crown is made of blue cheese. Her scepter: a CURILED CURIING RAY.

She LAUGHS — a cackling, bubbling sound.

**SPOILINA**  
Dairy shall rot! And so shall your dreams of balanced nutrition!

She raises her scepter. More GREEN LIGHT pulses outward.

**SPOILINA (CONT'D)**  
Every cafeteria. Every kitchen. Every refrigerator in Dairyopolis... will know my power!

---

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - CITYWIDE - DAY

The SPOILATION spreads:

- A GROCERY STORE: Produce section rots instantly
- A RESTAURANT: Kitchen staff flee from molding ingredients
- A HOME: The family watches in horror as their fridge contents turn fuzzy

**CITIZEN**  
What's happening to our food?!

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
*(alarmed)*  
Multiple spoilage events detected across the city. Source: Unknown biological weapon.

---

## ACT TWO: THE TEAM ASSEMBLES

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate watch SCREENS showing the spoilage spreading.

**MILK MAN**  
This is worse than Vil Laine!

**M.U.U.**  
The biological agent appears to be mold-based. Extremely potent.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Mold? That's nasty.

**M.U.U.**  
Worse — it's targeting the city's food supply. Children are particularly affected.

**MILK MAN**  
Then we need to move fast.

His WRIST COMPUTER beeps. A MAP appears.

**M.U.U. (CONT'D)**  
The source appears to be coming from Dairyopolis Elementary. There: the Queen appears to be commanding the attack.

**MILK MAN**  
A queen? Let me guess — she's got a fungal throne?

**M.U.U.**  
Precisely. I've designated her: Spoilina. The Mold Queen.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Spoilina. I like that name. Sounds like a villain.

**MILK MAN**  
Let's go give her a piece of our minds.

---

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS ELEMENTARY - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate arrive at the school. The building is COVERED in MOLD. Fuzzy green patches grow on walls, windows, the playground.

**BOY LACTATE**  
That's... disgusting.

**MILK MAN**  
Stay focused. We need to get inside and stop that Spoilina.

**BOY LACTATE**  
But how do we fight mold? We can't punch it!

**MILK MAN**  
We need to think smarter. What's mold's weakness?

**BOY LACTATE**  
思考... Clean? Heat? Cold?

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Mold is a fungus. It thrives in damp, dark environments. It is inhibited by certain cultures and bacteria.

**MILK MAN**  
Cultures! Like... probiotic cultures?

**M.U.U.**  
Precisely. A dairy-based culture spray could neutralize the mold.

**MILK MAN**  
Then we need a Dairy Diffuser!

---

## ACT THREE: THE BATTLE AT SCHOOL

### INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

The CAFETERIA is a NIGHTMARE. Fuzzy MOLD covers every surface. The air is GREEN.

At the center: Spoilina on her MOLD THRONE — a massive chair made of fermented cheese, dripping with goo.

**SPOILINA**  
*(reigning)*  
Welcome, little milk products. Come to join the rot?

**MILK MAN**  
Spoilina! Surrender now!

**SPOILINA**  
Surrender? To YOU? I am the MOLD QUEEN! I control ALL spoilage!

She raises her scepter. GREEN BEAMS fire at them.

**MILK MAN**  
(scattering)  
Spread out!

Milk Man DODGES, using his Lactose Lasso to swing between tables.

Boy Lactate activates his WRISTLETS — the LACTOSE BEAM.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Take THIS!

He FIRES white beams at Spoilina's throne. The mold SIZZLES but doesn't fully die.

**SPOILINA**  
*(laughing)*  
Your beams are weak! Lactose can't stop fungal growth!

**BOY LACTATE**  
We need something stronger!

---

### ACTION SEQUENCE: THE HALLWAY CHASE

Milk Man runs through the HALLWAY, covered in mold:

- He shields his face
- The mold GROWS on his suit
- He's slowing down

**MILK MAN**  
*(coughing)*  
The mold... it's everywhere!

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Milk Man! You're being affected! Use your suit's decontamination field!

He presses a BUTTON on his gauntlet. A WAVE of WHITE LIGHT pulses out, BURNING off the mold.

**MILK MAN**  
Thanks, M.U.U.!

---

### BACK IN THE CAFETERIA

Boy Lactate is cornered. Spoilina's mold tentacles grow from the floor, wrapping around his legs.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Milk Man! A little help?!

Milk Man enters, fresh from decontamination.

**MILK MAN**  
On it!

He uses the LACTOSE LASSO to grab Boy Lactate, PULLING him free.

**SPOILINA**  
You can't save him! You can't save ANYONE!

She presses a BUTTON on her throne. The entire CAFETERIA FLOOR turns to MOLD.

Both heroes SINK.

---

## ACT FOUR: THE COUNTERATTACK

### INT. MOLD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The heroes are waist-deep in growing mold. It's WARM and WET and DISGUSTING.

**BOY LACTATE**  
This is the worst!

**MILK MAN**  
Keep moving!

He pulls out the DAIRY DIFFUSER POD — a small device.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
M.U.U.! Activate the Diffuser!

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Deploying!

He THROWS the pod. It LANDS near Spoilina's throne and EXPLODES.

A CLOUD of WHITE SPRAY expands — PROBIOTIC CULTURES.

**SPOILINA**  
NO! NOT THE CULTURES!

The mold SIZZLES, DIES, RETREATS.

**BOY LACTATE**  
It's working!

The mold floor DISSOLVES. Spoilina's throne CRUMBLES.

---

### THE FINAL BATTLE

Spoilina, weakened, crawls toward her scepter.

**SPOILINA**  
You'll never—

Milk Man STEPS on her hand.

**MILK MAN**  
Game over, mold queen.

**SPOILINA**  
You'll regret this! I'll come back! I'll grow from the smallest spore!

**MILK MAN**  
We'll be ready.

He uses the Lasso to BIND her.

---

## ACT FIVE: THE AFTERMATH

### EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

The mold is GONE. The sun shines. Children peek out from behind corners.

**TEACHER**  
Is it safe?

**MILK MAN**  
*(smiling)*  
It's safe now. But maybe... wash your lunchboxes?

The children CHEER.

---

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate report to M.U.U.

**M.U.U.**  
Excellent work today. Spoilina has been contained.

**BOY LACTATE**  
So... does this mean lunch is safe again?

**M.U.U.**  
All contaminated food has been neutralized. Lunch will resume tomorrow.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Yes!

**MILK MAN**  
Good work today, kid.

**BOY LACTATE**  
I almost got moldy!

**MILK MAN**  
But you didn't. And that's what counts.

---

## EPILOGUE

### INT. THE CREAMERY - HERO LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Milk Man sits, exhausted. Boy Lactate enters with two MILK BOTTLES.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Got us some victory milk!

**MILK MAN**  
*(taking it)*  
Thanks.

They DRINK.

**BOY LACTATE**  
So... Spoilina got away with a warning about coming back from spores.

**MILK MAN**  
These villains always come back.

**BOY LACTATE**  
You think we'll ever... beat them for good?

**MILK MAN**  
*(thinking)*  
Maybe not beat them. But we keep trying. That's what heroes do.

He finishes his milk.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
Now get some rest. Tomorrow brings new dairy challenges.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Yes, sir!

A new weapon. More powerful than mold.
