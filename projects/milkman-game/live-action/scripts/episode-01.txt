## COLD OPEN

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - DAY

A serene 1950s-style city. SUBURBAN HOMES with white picket fences. A DOWNTOWN with art deco buildings. Everything is PERFECT.

**CLOSEUPS:**
- A milkman on his route, smiling
- A child drinking from a milk carton
- Cows in a pasture, peacefully grazing

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
*(AI voice, calm)*  
Dairyopolis. The city where dairy flows like rivers and heroes walk among us.

### EXT. THE CREAMERY - DAY

A gleaming Art Deco building in the city center. The sign reads: "THE CREAMERY - Guardians of Dairy Since 1952"

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Within The Creamery, we protect the city's most precious resource: milk.

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A high-tech command center. SCREENS show milk flow charts, dairy inventory, citizen dairy consumption levels.

At the center: a massive CRYO-CHURN POD, frosted over, dormant.

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
And within our walls, a hero sleeps. Awaiting the day when dairy is threatened.

**M.U.U.** *(on screen)*: "System status: Optimal. Hero chamber: Dormant. Threat level: None."

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - SILO DISTRICT - DAY

A DARK FIGURE emerges from shadows. **VIL LAINE** — a villain in white and blue, with sleek tech and an evil grin.

She carries a briefcase. Inside: the REVERSE HOMOGENIZER — a device that makes milk separate on a molecular level.

**VIL LAINE**  
*(cackling)*  
The day dairy stood still... is about to begin.

---

## ACT ONE: THE ATTACK

### EXT. DOWNTOWN DAIRYOPOLIS - DAY

Citizens walk peacefully. Then —

The SKY DARKENS. A WHIRRING NOISE.

**CITIZEN #1**  
What's that sound?

Everyone looks up. A massive DEVICE hovers over the city: the REVERSE HOMOGENIZER, deployed by Vil Laine from a floating MILK TOWER.

**CITIZEN #2**  
It's a machine! It's turning the sky white!

The device ACTIVATES. A WAVE of white energy pulses outward.

### EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The wave hits:

- A MILK TRUCK — its milk turns into chunks, then water, then nothing
- A DAIRY FOUNTAIN — the milk separates into curds and whey, then solidifies
- A CHILD'S MILK CARTON — the liquid inside separates into white solid chunks

**CITIZEN #1**  
MY MILK! It's... it's GOING AWAY!

**CHILD**  
Mommy, what's happening to my cereal?!

PANIC spreads. Citizens scream, run, clutch their dairy products in terror.

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

ALARMS blare. RED LIGHTS flash.

**M.U.U.**  
*(alarmed)*  
ALERT: Milk integrity dropping. City-wide contamination detected. Threat level: SKIM.

SCREENS show the REVERSE HOMOGENIZER, spreading its effect.

**M.U.U. (CONT'D)**  
Initiating emergency protocols. Activating Milk Man.

The CRYO-CHURN POD begins to GLOW. Frost melts away.

**M.U.U.**  
Milk Man — wake up. Dairyopolis needs you.

---

## ACT TWO: THE HERO AWAKENS

### INT. THE CREAMERY - HERO CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The POD OPENS. FROSTbillows out.

Standing inside: **MILK MAN**.

He's a towering figure in white and blue. His suit has a milk droplet emblem on the chest. A white cape flows behind him. He wears a MILK DROPLET HELMET with a visor.

He steps out, stretching.

**MILK MAN**  
*(yawning)*  
Was it a good nap?

**M.U.U.**  
*(on screen)*  
Threat detected, Milk Man. City-wide dairy emergency.

**MILK MAN**  
*(grinning)*  
Then let's not keep them waiting.

He grabs his weapon from a wall rack: the **LACTOSE LASSO** — a rope of glowing white energy.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
How bad is it?

**M.U.U.**  
Vil Laine has deployed a Reverse Homogenizer. Milk is separating at the molecular level. The city has approximately three hours before all dairy is destroyed.

**MILK MAN**  
Three hours? That's not enough time for a commercial break.

He runs toward the exit.

---

### EXT. CITY CENTER - DAY

Milk Man bursts from The Creamery, cape flowing. Citizens STOP and STARE.

**CITIZEN #1**  
It's Milk Man! He's awake!

**CITIZEN #2**  
Thank dairy! We're saved!

Milk Man surveys the chaos. The sky is white with separated milk molecules. The ground is covered in solidified dairy.

**MILK MAN**  
This is worse than I thought.

His WRIST COMPUTER beeps. A map appears: showing the Reverse Homogenizer's location.

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
The device is on top of Milk Tower. I recommend immediate intervention.

**MILK MAN**  
On it.

He takes off running, leaping onto a MILK CRATE, then bouncing off a BUTTER STATUE, gaining height.

---

## ACT THREE: THE BATTLE

### EXT. MILK TOWER - DAY

A towering cylindrical tower, used for milk storage. Vil Laine stands atop, controlling the Reverse Homogenizer.

**VIL LAINE**  
*(laughing)*  
Soon, the entire city's dairy will be destroyed! And without milk, these people will realize...

She pulls a LEVER.

**VIL LAINE (CONT'D)**  
...they never NEEDED it!

The device WHIRRS LOUDER. The effect SPREADS.

### EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Milk Man arrives on the scene, dodging falling curd chunks.

**MILK MAN**  
Vil Laine! Stop this at once!

**VIL LAINE** *(from above)*  
Milk Man! I was hoping you'd wake up! This will be so much more... satisfying.

She presses a BUTTON. Two BUTTER DRONES launch from the tower, flying toward Milk Man.

### ACTION SEQUENCE

**MILK MAN** fights the Butter Drones with his Lactose Lasso:

- He SWINGS the lasso, knocking Drone #1 out of the sky
- Drone #2 dives; Milk Man rolls, lashes out, wraps the drone
- He YANKS, sending it crashing into a dairy truck

**VIL LAINE**  
*(impressed)*  
Not bad. But have you met my SECRET WEAPON?

She pulls a COVER off a second device: the MILK SEPARATOR CANNON.

**VIL LAINE (CONT'D)**  
Say goodbye to your dairy destiny!

She FIRES. A beam of white energy shoots toward Milk Man.

**MILK MAN**  
Whoa!

He DUCKS. The beam misses, hitting a building. The building's milk-based contents EXPLODE into curd confetti.

---

### NEW DEVELOPMENT - BOY LACtATE ARRIVES

A CHEESE-WHEEL HOVERCYCLE descends from the sky. Riding it: **BOY LACtATE** — a teenage hero in yellow and orange, with a confident smirk.

He's young, energetic, and carries a belt of CALCIUM TABLETS.

**BOY LACtATE**  
Milk Man! I heard there was a dairy emergency!

**MILK MAN**  
Boy Lactate! Perfect timing!

**BOY LACtATE**  
What do we do?

**MILK MAN**  
Cover me while I take down that Reverse Homogenizer!

**BOY LACtATE**  
You got it!

Boy Lactate throws CALCIUM TABLETS like grenades at the Butter Drones:

- Tablet #1: EXPLODES on Drone #3, coating it in hardened calcium
- Tablet #2: Hits the Milk Separator Cannon, jamming it
- Tablet #3: Flies into the tower's control panel, causing sparks

**VIL LAINE**  
*(angry)*  
You'll regret that, you curd-brains!

### THE FINAL ASSAULT

Milk Man runs toward the tower, climbing:

- Jumps between MILK PIPES
- Swings on a CREAMER CONVEYOR
- Uses his Lactose Lasso to pull himself up

He reaches the top platform. Vil Laine stands between him and the Reverse Homogenizer.

**VIL LAINE**  
You can't stop progress, Milk Man! Milk is OBSOLETE!

**MILK MAN**  
Milk is NOT obsolete! It's the foundation of life!

**VIL LAINE**  
Then let's see what happens when it's GONE!

She charges at him. They FIGHT:

- Milk Man uses the Lasso; Vil Laine dodges with tech boots
- She pulls a DAIRY DAGGER; he blocks with his gauntlet
- He SPIKINS her, sending her sliding back

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
Give it up, Vil Laine!

**VIL LAINE**  
Never!

She lunges ONE MORE TIME. Milk Man grabs her wrist, SPINS her around, and uses the Lasso to BIND her.

**MILK MAN**  
You're under arrest, villain.

**VIL LAINE**  
*(defiant)*  
This isn't over!

---

## ACT FOUR: THE RESCUE

### EXT. MILK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Milk Man stands over the captured Vil Laine. The Reverse Homogenizer is SPARKING, damaged in the fight.

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Milk Man, the Reverse Homogenizer is destabilizing. We need to redirect the energy before it causes a dairy cascade failure.

**MILK MAN**  
Understood.

He looks at the device, then at the city below.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
Boy Lactate! I need your help!

**BOY LACtATE** *(on hovercycle, below)*  
What do you need?

**MILK MAN**  
Distract the energy! Use your calcium tablets to create a buffer!

**BOY LACTATE**  
On it!

Boy Lactate throws tablets at the device in a PATTERN. Calcium surrounds the Reverse Homogenizer, creating a BARRIER.

Milk Man reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a DAIRY RECONSTITUTION MODULE.

**MILK MAN**  
M.U.U.! Redirect the power through this!

**M.U.U.** *(on wrist computer)*  
Understood. Redirecting in 3... 2... 1...

The Reverse Homogenizer's energy surges — then FLOWS into the Reconstitution Module.

The MODULE GLOWS. Milk Man THROWS it into the air.

It EXPLODES in a RAINBOW OF DAIRY:

- White light spreads across the city
- Separated milk molecules REJOIN
- Curds become liquid again
- The sky CLEARS

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - DAY

Citizens WATCH in AMAZEMENT as their milk RETURNS to its proper form.

**CITIZEN #1**  
My milk! It's... it's NORMAL again!

**CHILD**  
YAY! Milk Man saved our cereal!

Cheers erupt throughout the city.

### EXT. MILK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Vil Laine, still bound, watches in defeat.

**VIL LAINE**  
This isn't over, Milk Man. I'll be back.

**MILK MAN**  
I'll be here.

AUTHORITIES arrive in MILK TANKS, taking Vil Laine away.

---

## EPILOGUE

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate stand before M.U.U.'s screen.

**M.U.U.**  
Excellent work, heroes. Dairyopolis is safe. Again.

**MILK MAN**  
Couldn't have done it without the kid.

**BOY LACTATE**  
*(grinning)*  
I'm not a kid, I'm a sidekick!

**MILK MAN** *(patting his shoulder)*  
That's the spirit.

**M.U.U.**  
Vil Laine has been secured. But there may be more villains waiting in the wings.

**MILK MAN**  
We'll be ready.

He looks at the city through the window.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
(aside to audience)  
And remember: milk does a body good. See you next time!

**WINK.**

### POST-CREDITS SCENE

### INT. UNDERGROUND LAIR - DARK

Vil Laine sits in a holding cell. A SHADOW approaches.

**SHADOW**  
*(voice)*  
You failed.

**VIL LAINE**  
The Milk Man was stronger than I anticipated.

**SHADOW**  
Strength can be... countered.

A hand emerges from the shadows, holding a DEVICE: the UHT INJECTOR — capable of making milk shelf-stable for decades.

**SHADOW (CONT'D)**  
Let's see how he handles EXTENDED shelf life.

**VIL LAINE** *(smirking)*  
I'll get out of here soon. And when I do...

**SHADOW**  
We'll finish what you started.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
