## COLD OPEN

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - DAY

A peaceful morning. Citizens walk to work. Milk flows through pipes.

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Dairyopolis. A city at peace.

Then —

**CITIZEN**  
LOOK UP!

Hundreds of PIGEONS swarm into view. But these aren't normal pigeons. Each carries a MOLDY CHEESE CUBE with a SPARKLING TIMER.

**CITIZEN #2**  
What are those?!

The pigeons DIVEBOMB, dropping their cheese cubes:

- A CUBE hits a MILK TRUCK — EXPLOSION of blue cheese
- A CUBE hits a DAIRY FOUNTAIN — instant MOLD
- A CUBE hits a PLAYGROUND — children RUN

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
*(alarmed)*  
Attack detected. Airborne threat. Pigeons carrying explosive cheese devices.

---

## ACT ONE: FEATHERS OF DOOM

### EXT. CITY PARK - CONTINUOUS

**COLONEL CURD** — a pigeon with a military beret and a tiny eye patch — lands on a statue. He carries a TINY MEGAPHONE.

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(squawking through megaphone, translated)*  
Citizens of Dairyopolis! You are under attack by the Feathery Force! Surrender your dairy... or be CURDLED!

Citizens RUN SCREAMING.

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

ALARMS blare. SCREENS show pigeons everywhere.

**M.U.U.**  
Multiple airborne threats detected. Pigeons with explosive payloads.

**MILK MAN**  
Pigeons? Who's controlling pigeons?

**M.U.U.**  
Scanning... I detect a leader. Designate: Colonel Curd. A military-trained pigeon with enhanced intelligence.

**BOY LACTATE**  
A PIGEON? That's ridiculous!

**M.U.U.**  
Nevertheless, the threat is real. The cheese cubes are anti-feta explosives.

**MILK MAN**  
Anti-feta? Those are some cheesy weapons.

---

## ACT TWO: TAKING FLIGHT

### INT. CREAMERY - HERO BAY - CONTINUOUS

Milk Man and Boy Lactate prepare:

- Milk Man checks his LACTOSE LASSO
- Boy Lactate loads CALCIUM TABLETS into his belt

**MILK MAN**  
Alright, kid. You ready for aerial combat?

**BOY LACTATE**  
I was born ready! ...Wait, pigeons can fly, right?

**MILK MAN**  
That's why we're using the Milk Cycle.

He presses a BUTTON. A MILK CYCLE emerges from the wall — a white motorcycle with MILK JETS.

**BOY LACTATE**  
That's SO cool!

**MILK MAN**  
Hop on!

They MOUNT up. The cycle ROARS to life.

**M.U.U.**  
Good luck, heroes.

---

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - CITY STREETS - DAY

The Milk Cycle races through streets, dodging falling cheese cubes.

**MILK MAN**  
*(driving)*  
We need to take out Colonel Curd first!

**BOY LACTATE**  
*(looking up)*  
There! On that statue!

Colonel Curd stands on a statue of a COW, commanding his forces.

**MILK MAN**  
Let's give those pigeons something to squawk about!

He steers toward the statue, JUMPING the cycle in a loop.

---

### EXT. COW STATUE - CONTINUOUS

Milk Man LANDS on the statue. Boy Lactate jumps off, rolling.

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(squawking)*  
The Milk Man! Defend the nest!

Pigeons DIVEBOMB from all directions.

**MILK MAN**  
Use the Anti-Feta Launcher!

Boy Lactate pulls out a GUN-LIKE DEVICE.

**BOY LACTATE**  
Anti-Feta Launcher, engage!

He FIRES — streams of WHITE FOAM at the pigeons:

- Pigeons hit by foam FALL, their cheese cubes DISABLED
- Foam creates a BARRIER, protecting the heroes
- Colonel Curd's wing is grazed

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(angry squawk)*  
Retreat! Regroup! FEATHER DIVE!

The pigeons SCATTER.

---

## ACT THREE: THE SKY BATTLE

### EXT. DAIRYOPOLIS - SKYSCRAPERS - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate pursue on the Milk Cycle:

- Weaving between buildings
- Dodging cheese cube explosions
- Taking out pigeons one by one

**MILK MAN**  
The pigeons are retreating! They must have a nest!

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
Affirmative. I'm tracking their signal to... the Grain Silo.

**BOY LACTATE**  
The Grain Silo? But that's outside the city!

**MILK MAN**  
Exactly. That's where they're hiding.

He TWISTS the throttle. The cycle JETS forward.

---

### EXT. GRAIN SILO - DAY

A massive complex of cylindrical silos. Pigeons COVER every surface.

In the center: Colonel Curd's NEST — built from stolen cheese curds.

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(on megaphone)*  
You can't defeat us! We control the skies!

**MILK MAN**  
From where I'm standing... it looks like you control the ceiling.

---

### INT. GRAIN SILO - CONTINUOUS

The heroes enter, cautious.

Inside: THOUSANDS of pigeons. A pigeon ARMY.

**BOY LACTATE**  
There are SO many!

**MILK MAN**  
We need to cut the head off the snake.

He spots Colonel Curd on a central perch.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
Cover me!

He RUNS toward the perch. Pigeons ATTACK:

- He uses the Lasso as a SHIELD
- He kicks pigeons away
- He's getting overwhelmed

**BOY LACTATE**  
Milk Man! Use the Lacto-Spritz!

Milk Man pulls a CANISTER from his belt, SPRAYS white mist:

The mist HITS the pigeons, PARALYZING them temporarily.

**MILK MAN**  
Good thinking!

---

### THE FINAL CONFRONTATION

Milk Man reaches the perch. Colonel Curd stands his ground.

**COLONEL CURD**  
You may have won this battle... but the Feathery Force will return!

**MILK MAN**  
Not if I have anything to say about it.

He uses the LACTOSE LASSO, SNARES Colonel Curd.

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(squawking)*  
Curd! Curd-curd-curd!

**MILK MAN**  
You're under arrest, Colonel. Count of... several thousand.

---

## ACT FOUR: PEACE RETURNS

### EXT. GRAIN SILO - DAY

Pigeons are rounded up in special CAGE TRAPS. Animal control loads them.

**MILK MAN**  
All pigeons secured?

**M.U.U. (V.O.)**  
All explosive cheese cubes have been deactivated. The threat is neutralized.

**BOY LACTATE**  
So... what do we do with a thousand pigeons?

**MILK MAN**  
Relocate them. Far from the city.

**BOY LACTATE**  
To the country?

**MILK MAN**  
To somewhere they can be... less destructive.

---

### INT. THE CREAMERY - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Milk Man and Boy Lactate debrief.

**M.U.U.**  
Excellent work today. Dairyopolis is safe.

**BOY LACTATE**  
But pigeons? Who even THINKS of pigeon villains?

**M.U.U.**  
The villain population is creative.

**MILK MAN**  
That's what makes our job interesting.

He looks at the city through the window.

**MILK MAN (CONT'D)**  
(aside to audience)  
And remember: dairy is a gift. Don't take it for granted!

**WINK.**

---

## EPILOGUE

### INT. CREAMERY - HERO LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Boy Lactate is eating a MILK BISCUIT.

**BOY LACTATE**  
You know what I'm glad about?

**MILK MAN**  
What?

**BOY LACTATE**  
Pigeons don't eat cheese.

**MILK MAN**  
Really?

**BOY LACTATE**  
Nope. They're grain birds. So... that was all just villainy.

**MILK MAN**  
Villainy with good production values.

**BOY LACTATE**  
True.

Hey! The leader's missing!

In the distance: Colonel Curd, flying toward a DARK FIGURE waiting by a van.

**COLONEL CURD**  
*(squawking)*  
Mission failed. But I've learned their weaknesses.

**DARK FIGURE**  
Good. We'll need that information.

The van DRIVES AWAY.
