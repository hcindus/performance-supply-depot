- Milk Man must cleanse with mist
- Failed cleanse = citizens attack player
- Successful cleanse = citizens join as allies

- Dialogue boxes show his hesitation
- Player can exploit this to deal extra damage

### The Tainted Cream
- Vil sabotages vat during battle
- Changes level 3 dynamics
- Citizens become enraged instead of hypnotized
- Harder enemies but allies fight back

### Boss Battle: Shoezet Syndicate
