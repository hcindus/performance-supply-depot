## PAGE 2 (5 panels)

**Panel 1:** Interior — Daily Dairyopolis News office. Reporters rushing. Editor at desk.

**Editor:** "Get me a headline! Something about the upcoming Cheese Festival!"

**Reporter:** "Sir, there's... there's been an incident at Grand Dairyopolis Market!"

**Panel 2:** Close on editor's face, shocked.

**Editor:** "Incident? What kind of—"

**Sound Effect:** *CRASH!* (from outside)

**Panel 3:** Wide shot — Through window, we see smoke rising from market district. People running in streets.

**Caption:** Minutes later...

**Panel 4:** Street level. Citizens in panic. Cheese carts overturned. A Woman clutching empty milk bottle, crying theatrical tears.

**Woman:** "The milk... it's GONE!"

**Panel 5:** On top of overturned cheese cart stands a mysterious figure. Purple cape, milk-bottle monocle (absurd). This is **VIL LAINE**.

**Vil:** "Citizens of Dairyopolis! Your precious dairy... is **CURDLED!**"

---

## PAGE 3 (6 panels)

**Panel 1:** Vil's dramatic monologue pose. Arms spread.

**Vil:** "For too long you've depended on cow's milk! Strengthening your bones! Building your bodies!"

**Panel 2:** Vil produces bottle of... something. It glows ominously.

**Vil:** "But I offer... AN ALTERNATIVE!"

**Panel 3:** Close on bottle label: "HUMAN LACTATE — PURE • STRONG • REVOLUTIONARY"

**Vil:** "My formula! Harvested from the finest... donors."

**Panel 4:** Crowd reaction. Confusion, some disgust, one guy intrigued.

**Random Guy:** "...Is it organic?"

**Panel 5:** Vil's villainous gloating continues.

**Vil:** "With this Reverse Homogenizer, I shall DESTABILIZE your dairy supply! Your precious milk... will SEPARATE!"

**Panel 6:** Reveal of the machine — massive, 1950s sci-fi aesthetic, lots of unnecessary chrome and blinking lights.

**Machine Label:** REVERSE HOMOGENIZER MK. I
**Warning Sticker:** THIS DEVICE VIOLATES THERMODYNAMICS

---

## PAGE 4 (5 panels)

**Panel 1:** Cut to: THE CREAMERY interior. Sterile white walls, futuristic 1950s tech. This is Milk Man's base.

**Caption:** Meanwhile, beneath the streets...

**Computer Voice (M.U.U.):** "THREAT LEVEL: SKIM. INFILTRATOR DETECTED AT GRAND DAIRYOPOLIS MARKET."

**Panel 2:** Close on cryo-chamber. Frosted glass. Shadowed figure within.

**M.U.U.:** "PROTOCOL: REACTIVATION. SUBJECT: PROJECT 5912."

**Panel 3:** Chamber opens with HISS of nitrogen vapor. Silhouette emerging.

**Sound Effect:** **HISSSSSS...**

**Panel 4:** Full reveal — **MILK MAN** in his costume for the first time. White bodysuit, red cape (per your specs — NOT blue!), "MM" emblem on chest. Milk bottles on utility belt. Confident, warm expression.

**Milk Man:** "Someone's... curdling the city's cream?"

**Panel 5:** He's already moving, grabbing Lactose Lasso from wall mount. Behind him, a smaller cryo-chamber opens.

**M.U.U.:** "ADDITIONAL REACTIVATION: SIDEKICK PROTOCOL."

**Milk Man:** "Boy Lactate! We've got work to do!"

---

## PAGE 5 (7 panels)

**Panel 1:** Boy Lactate (15 years old, energetic) emerges from his chamber, already suiting up. His "BL" emblem.

**Boy Lactate:** "What's the situation, Milk Man? More spoiled yogurt?"

**Panel 2:** Milk Man hands him the Cheese-Wheel Hovercycle keys.

**Milk Man:** "Worse. Someone's reversing the homogenization process."

**Boy Lactate:** "That's... that's dairy heresy!"

**Panel 3:** The two of them on the hovercycle. Milk Man driving, Boy behind with tablet.

**Milk Man:** "Full report en route. Get me the specs on that Reverse Homogenizer."

**Boy Lactate:** "Already on it! T.J. Mooo's clearance database..."

**Panel 4:** Boy Lactate's tablet shows schematic of the machine.

**Boy Lactate:** "Whoa. This thing could destabilize milk at the molecular level!"

**Panel 5:** Hovercycle bursts from The Creamery's hidden exit, now flying through streets.

**Sound Effect:** **VROOOOOM!**

**Panel 6:** Civilians point up, hopeful.

**Little Girl:** "Look! It's Milk Man!"

**Panel 7:** Milk Man salutes from the cycle.

**Milk Man:** "Never fear, Dairyopolis! The cream always rises!"

**Boy Lactate:** (quietly) "Was that... was that your first catchphrase?"

**Milk Man:** "I'm workshopping it."

---

## PAGE 6 (6 panels)

**Panel 1:** Back at the market. Vil's machine is working. Milk in cartons is visibly separating — cream rising weirdly fast.

**Vil:** "Yes! SEPARATE! Your precious homogenization MEANS NOTHING!"

**Panel 2:** Milk Man arrives. Dramatic landing on top of cheese cart.

**Sound Effect:** **CRASH!**

**Vil:** "You! The frozen guardian!"

**Panel 3:** Milk Man vs. Vil face-off. Classic hero-villain confrontation.

**Milk Man:** "Vil Laine. I know your file. Biochemist. Lactose-intolerant. Obsession with... 'improving' dairy."

**Vil:** (touching his chest dramatically) "Intolerant? I am SUPERIOR! Human lactate is the FUTURE!"

**Panel 4:** Boy Lactate circling on hovercycle, analyzing machine.

**Boy Lactate:** "Milk Man! The machine's got a cooling core! If we can—"

**Vil:** (to henchmen) "SEIZE THE BOY!"

**Panel 5:** Goons (hench-people in dairy-themed jumpsuits) chase Boy Lactate.

**Sound Effect:** **WHOOSH!**

**Panel 6:** Boy Lactate's clever — he tricks them into crashing into cheese display.

**Boy Lactate:** "Guys! Watch out for the Gouda!"

**Sound Effect:** **SPLAT!**

---

## PAGE 7 (5 panels)

**Panel 1:** Milk Man activates Lactose Lasso — it glows with dairy-energy.

**Milk Man:** "Let's put the unity back in 'community fridges.'"

**Vil:** (groaning at pun) "That... that was terrible."

**Panel 2:** Milk Man whips the lasso, catching the Reverse Homogenizer's intake valve.

**Sound Effect:** **WHIP-CRACK!**

**Panel 3:** Machine sparks. Vil panics at controls.

**Vil:** "No! You'll destabilize the destabilizer!"

**Milk Man:** "That's kind of my job."

**Panel 4:** Boy Lactate throws Calcium Grenade (small pill that explodes in calcium flash).

**Sound Effect:** **FLASH! BANG!**

**Panel 5:** Temporarily blinded, Vil stumbles. Machine smoking but not destroyed.

**Vil:** "This isn't over! The milk... will RISE against you!"

---

## PAGE 8 (6 panels)

**Panel 1:** Vil escapes via butter-drone (drone made of butter, absurd but effective).

**Sound Effect:** **BZZZZ-SQUELCH!**

**Milk Man:** "He's getting away!"

**Panel 2:** But the immediate threat is over. Machine deactivated. Citizens cheer (politely, 1950s style).

**Panel 3:** Milk Man helps up overturned cheese cart vendor.

**Vendor:** "You saved my Gouda, hero!"

**Milk Man:** "Just doing my... dairy duty."

**Panel 4:** Boy Lactate arrives, slightly out of breath.

**Boy Lactate:** "Should we pursue? I've got the hovercycle gassed up!"

**Panel 5:** Milk Man looks up at Vil's escape vector.

**Milk Man:** "Not yet. We need to understand what he's really planning."

**Panel 6:** Milk Man finds something on the ground — dropped by Vil. Business card: "VIL LAINE — HUMAN DAIRY CONSULTANT" with mysterious address.

**Milk Man:** "But I think... I think this is just the beginning."

---

## PAGE 9-10 (Double Page Spread)

**Full Spread:** Milk Man and Boy Lactate standing heroically amid the recovering market. Cheese arranged artfully. Citizens cheering. In the sky, the butter-drone is a distant speck. The sun setting behind The Creamery.

**Caption (centered, large):**
> "DAIRYOPOLIS WAS SAVED..."
> "BUT THE WAR FOR WHOLE MILK..."
> "HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN."

**Small credit bottom right:**
> THE END... OF THE BEGINNING

**Next Issue Box:**
> NEXT: "SPOILINA STRIKES!"
> When mold attacks school lunches,
> Milk Man faces his most... PUNGENT enemy!

**Subject:** What IS Homogenization?

**Panel 1:** Kid reading cereal box.

**Panel 2:** Milk Man appears in educational inset.

**Milk Man:** "Homogenization breaks fat molecules so cream doesn't rise to the top!"

**Panel 3:** Diagram showing before/after.

**Panel 4:** Kid nods, enlightened.

**Kid:** "So... cream SHOULD rise?"

**Milk Man:** "In nature, yes. In your carton, no. That's the miracle of science!"

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**For Artist:**
- Study 1950s advertising illustration
- Milk Man cape is **RED** (not blue)
- The Creamery should look like art deco cathedral meets dairy plant
- Vil Laine should be theatrical but not frightening (kid-friendly)
- Boy Lactate should look capable and enthusiastic

**Color Notes:**
- Day scenes: Cream, blue, gold palette
- Vil's machine: Purple, green, warning yellow
- The Creamery: Sterile white, silver, heroic blue accents

**Lettering Notes:**
- Vil gets dramatic, jagged dialogue bubbles when ranting
- M.U.U. gets robotic square boxes
- Sound effects should be BIG and fun

**TBR (To Be Revealed):**
- Milk Man's civilian identity (hint: he's a milkman)
- Full origin of The Creamery
- Why Boy Lactate is "sidekick" not "apprentice"
- Connection between Vil and future villains
