## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Tone: Self-Aware Earnestness

**The Rule:** Take the world seriously, wink at the audience.

**Comedy DNA:**
- Character reactions are genuine
- Situations are absurd
- Never punch down
- Dairy puns are mandatory but not excessive
- Heart first, humor second

**Example Comic Dialogue:**
```
NARRATOR: "In a world of chaos... one man delivers."
[Panel: Milk Man dramatically posing with milk bottles]

VIL LAINE: "Your precious dairy can't save you now!"
[Panel: Vil activates Reverse Homogenizer]

MILK MAN: "That's what you think! I've been... HOMOGENIZED for this!"
[Panel: Crowd groans, one person claps politely]

NARRATOR: "Okay, that pun was terrible. But he meant it sincerely."
```
