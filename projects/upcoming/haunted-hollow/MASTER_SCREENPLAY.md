# ACT I: THE WATCHER'S BURDEN
## John's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

The hollow is vibrant, the sun filtering through sycamore trees. **JOHN**, a young man in his 20s, strong and hopeful, plows the field with a horse-drawn plow. A young woman, the **WIFE (LILA)**, in her 20s, with raven-black hair and an ethereal beauty, watches from the edge of the field, a mischievous smile on her lips.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Young, earnest)*  
I met her in 1910, a girl with eyes like starlight. She said her name was Lila, and I loved her the moment I saw her. I didn't know she was a witch, or what she'd do to me.

The Wife approaches, offering John a cup of water. He drinks, unaware of the potion within. His eyes widen, and he staggers, falling to his knees. She whispers a chant, binding him to her.

**LILA**  
*(Seductively)*  
You're mine now, John. You'll watch, and you'll love me, no matter what I do.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
She bound me with her magic. I couldn't leave her, couldn't stop her. I had to watch—always watchin'.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The cabin is newly built, but already weathered. John, now in his late 20s, works in the field. The Wife, still radiant, greets a young **MERCHANT**, a wiry man in his 20s with a sly grin, as he arrives with his mule. They laugh, her touch hypnotic. John watches from the field, his fists clenched, unable to intervene.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
It started with the merchant, back in '15. He'd come every few months, tradin' his goods—and takin' my wife. She loved it, laughin' in his arms while I watched from the shadows.

---

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

The Wife, now in her 30s, sits by the fire with the **BLACKSMITH (CALEB)**, a burly man in his 20s, his arms soot-stained. A young child, about 4 years old, plays nearby, his features strikingly similar to the Merchant's—sharp eyes, sly grin. John, in his 30s, stands in the doorway, his face etched with pain.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1920, Caleb the blacksmith was comin' 'round too. They didn't care that I saw 'em. And the children… that boy looks like the merchant. Another came in '18, with Caleb's broad shoulders. They ain't mine, but I raise 'em, 'cause I got no choice.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

The cabin is more weathered, the hollow darker. The Wife, now in her 40s, still beautiful, greets the **MAYOR**, a pompous man in his 50s, dressed in a fine suit. A teenage boy, resembling Caleb, works in the field beside John, now in his 40s, his face lined with years of torment. A younger child, about 5, with the Mayor's sharp nose, plays near the porch.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
The years dragged on, and more men came. The mayor started visitin' in the '20s, leavin' his mark in that boy there. Every child a reminder of what I can't stop. I'm powerless, bound by her spell.

---

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

John, now in his 50s, graying and stooped, delivers hay to the livery. The **LIVERY HAND**, a dim-witted man in his 30s, grins stupidly as the Wife, still alluring in her 50s, flirts with him behind the stable. A young girl, about 8, with the Livery Hand's vacant stare, watches from the fence.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand, that fool who can barely handle a horse, had his turn by 1940. Another child, another face that ain't mine. Forty years of this—watchin', hurtin', unable to stop 'em.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The cabin is dilapidated, the hollow oppressive. John, now in his 60s, sits on the porch, whittling with a knife, his eyes hollow. The Wife, in her 60s but still striking, greets the Merchant, now in his 60s, his coat more tattered but his grin unchanged. John watches, his grip on the knife tightening.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1950, I couldn't take no more. The merchant, Caleb, the mayor, the livery hand—they kept comin', and she kept welcomin' 'em. My children—none of 'em mine—stare at me with their fathers' faces. I'm done watchin'.

**FADE OUT.**

---

# ACT II: THE WITCH'S DANCE
## Lila's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

**LILA** (the Wife), young and radiant, watches John plow the field. She holds a vial of potion, her smile cruel.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
*(Seductively, with malice)*  
I was born with magic in my veins, a witch of the hollow. John was a simple boy, easy to break. I bound him in 1910, made him watch while I took what I wanted. I love the power—it feeds my soul.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

Lila, still youthful, embraces the Merchant as John watches from the field. She laughs, her pendant glowing faintly with a greenish light.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The merchant came first, in 1915. His silks and spices were a fine trade, but his touch was better. John watched, and I let him. His pain makes my magic stronger.

---

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

Lila, in her 30s, sits with Caleb by the fire, the Merchant's son playing nearby. She glances at John in the doorway, her smile triumphant.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Caleb joined us by 1920, his fire matchin' mine. The children came—little reminders of my power. John raises 'em, but they're mine to claim, just like their fathers.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

Lila, in her 40s, flirts with the Mayor, the Caleb-lookalike teenager working nearby. The Mayor's son plays on the porch, his sharp nose unmistakable.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The mayor brought his pride in the '20s, and I took it from him. Another child, another mark of my magic. The hollow hums with my power, but the mountains are watchin', and they don't approve.

---

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

Lila, in her 50s, laughs with the Livery Hand behind the stable, the girl with his vacant stare watching. John delivers hay, his face a mask of despair.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand, that simpleton, couldn't resist me by 1940. I take what I want, and I love bein' wanted. John's sufferin' is my delight, but I feel the hollow turnin' dark.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

Lila, in her 60s but still alluring, welcomes the Merchant again, her laughter echoing. She senses John on the porch, his presence heavier than ever.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Forty years, and I'm still the witch of this hollow. But John's eyes… they're different now. The mountains whisper judgment, and I fear my magic's gone too far.

**FADE OUT.**

---

# ACT III: THE TRADER'S FOLLY
## The Merchant's Perspective, 1915–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY (1915)

The young **MERCHANT**, in his 20s, rides his mule through a pass, his sack of goods clinking. He hums, his eyes sharp.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
*(Charming, greedy)*  
I first came to this hollow in 1915, hearin' tales of a woman fairer'n any jewel. I found her—Lila—and I've been comin' back ever since.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The Merchant meets Lila, as seen in Act I. He drapes a silk over her shoulders, her touch intoxicating. John watches from the field, powerless.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Her husband's a fool, watchin' us like a ghost. I take what I want, and she loves givin' it. I don't care if he's seen—I've been doin' this for years.

---

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

The Merchant, in his 30s, sits with Lila, the 4-year-old boy with his features playing nearby. John watches from the doorway, his pain palpable.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
By 1920, I saw my own face in her boy. She's a witch, sure enough, but I don't mind. I keep comin' back, sharin' her with that blacksmith now.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1935)

The Merchant, in his 40s, arrives again, his mule older, his goods more worn. Lila, still beautiful, welcomes him. The Merchant's son, now a teenager, eyes him warily from the field.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
The years pass, but Lila don't change. My boy's grown, lookin' more like me every day. John's still watchin', still weak. I take what I want, always will.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The Merchant, now in his 60s, sits with Lila by the fire, as seen in Act I. John offers tea, his smile chilling. The Merchant drinks, oblivious.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Forty years, and I'm still here, takin' what's mine. But this tea… it's bitter. My head's spinnin'…

The Merchant collapses, dead, his face frozen in shock.

**FADE OUT.**

---

# ACT IV: THE SMITH'S FIRE
## Caleb's Perspective, 1920–1950

**FADE IN:**

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (1920)

**CALEB**, a young blacksmith in his 20s, hammers iron, the forge roaring. Lila enters, her presence electric.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Gruff, proud)*  
I met Lila in 1920, and I couldn't resist her. She's a witch, but I don't care. I take what I want, even if her man's watchin'.

---

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DUSK (1920)

Lila and Caleb embrace, John watching from the ridge. Caleb smirks, defiant.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
John's up there, always watchin'. Let him. The merchant's been here too—we share her, and she loves it.

---

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1930)

Caleb, in his 30s, visits the cabin, Lila welcoming him. The 12-year-old boy with Caleb's broad shoulders works beside John, who glares at Caleb with silent rage.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
By 1930, my boy was growin' strong, lookin' like me. John raises him, but he's mine. I keep comin' back, year after year, takin' what's mine.

---

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1945)

Caleb, in his 40s, and Lila, still alluring, laugh by the forge. The hollow feels darker, the air heavier. John's silhouette on the ridge is a constant presence.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
The years don't stop us. Lila's magic keeps her beautiful, and I keep comin'. John's sufferin' don't mean nothin' to me.

---

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

Caleb, now in his 50s, sits with Lila, exhausted. She leaves, and John enters with his scythe, his eyes wild. Caleb stirs, but the blade comes down with a **THUD**.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Fading, horrified)*  
John… after all these years…

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT V: THE QUANTUM ECHOES
## Dr. Elena Harper's Perspective, 2025

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - DAY (2025)

The hollow is overgrown, the cabin and forge ruins barely visible. **DR. ELENA HARPER**, a researcher in her 30s, sets up camp. She has a laptop, a portable battery, and an Android tablet running DroidScript.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
*(Curious, analytical)*  
I'm Dr. Elena Harper, a quantum computing researcher. The legends of this hollow speak of a 40-year tale of betrayal and murder, from 1910 to 1950. I'm here to decode the echoes, using quantum states to uncover the truth.

---

### INT. ELENA'S TENT - DAY

Elena runs a 3-qubit circuit on IBM Quantum via her laptop, transferring the data to her tablet. The DroidScript app displays the simulation:

**Initial State:** |000⟩  
**State Vector:** [0.71, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.71, 0.00]  
**Measured State:** |000⟩

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The states encode the story: |000⟩ for John, |001⟩ for his wife, Lila, |010⟩ for the blacksmith, |011⟩ for the merchant, |100⟩ for the hollow. The neural network will classify them, but the noise is… unusual.

The tablet flickers, the noise level rising. The wind outside howls, whispers growing louder.

**ELENA**  
*(Alarmed)*  
The noise is spiking—my OODA loop can't keep up. It's like the hollow's interfering, mixing the perspectives across the decades.

Elena trains the NN, the app displaying:

```
State: |000⟩, Expected: 1, Predicted: 1
State: |111⟩, Expected: 1, Predicted: 0
State: |001⟩, Expected: 0, Predicted: 1
State: |110⟩, Expected: 0, Predicted: 0
Final Noise Level: 0.15
```

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The data's corrupted—John's story from 1910, Lila's magic in the '20s, the children born over the years… it's all jumbled. I hear whispers—children's voices, men's laughter, a woman's chant.

---

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - NIGHT

Elena sits by a campfire, the tablet showing distorted fragments of the story—John watching in 1915, Lila with the Mayor in 1930, a child with the Livery Hand's face in 1940. The whispers form words: "You shouldn't have come…"

**ELENA**  
*(Shaken)*  
The hollow's state—|100⟩—it's taking over. I need to stop—

The tablet hums, the screen displaying |100⟩. The campfire dies, and the spirits materialize—John, Lila, Caleb, the Merchant, and the children, their faces a haunting gallery of betrayal.

**FADE OUT.**

---

# ACT VI: THE HOLLOW'S JUDGMENT
## The Hollow's Perspective, 1910–2025

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - NIGHT (1950)

The hollow is dark, the moon blood-red. John, in his 60s, stands over Caleb's body in the forge, then kills Lila in the cabin, the children fleeing into the woods.

**HOLLOW (V.O.)**  
*(Deep, ancient)*  
I am the hollow, witness to 40 years of sin. From 1910 to 1950, I watched Lila bewitch John, drawin' men to her bed—the merchant, the blacksmith, the mayor, the livery hand. Her children, born of betrayal, filled this land with pain. John watched, powerless, 'til his madness took over.

---

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - NIGHT (1950)

The spirits of Lila, Caleb, the Merchant, and the children rise, surrounding John. The ground opens, swallowing them all, their screams echoing.

**HOLLOW (V.O.)**  
I claimed 'em in 1950, their souls trapped in my depths. But the curse lingered, a stain on this land.

---

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - NIGHT (2025)

Elena's tablet glows with the state |100⟩, the spirits surrounding her. The ground trembles, the whispers deafening.

**HOLLOW (V.O.)**  
Now, in 2025, Elena seeks my secrets with her quantum machine. I let her see the tale—John's torment, Lila's magic, the children's faces—but I twisted it with my noise. Her science can't fight my curse.

The ground opens again, dragging Elena and the spirits into the abyss, the tablet shattering as it falls.

---

### EXT. THE HOLLOW - DAWN (2025)

The hollow is silent, Elena's camp empty, the tablet's screen dark. The wind carries whispers—the voices of John, Lila, Caleb, the Merchant, the children, and now Elena.

**HOLLOW (V.O.)**  
They're all mine now, across the centuries. The mountains always win.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
*"Beware the hollow, where the shadows fall deep, for the mountains keep secrets—and they never sleep."*

**ROLL CREDITS.**
