# The Merchant's Secret
## Haunted Hollow - Ballad

**Tempo:** Slow | **Feeling:** Somber, secretive, tragic

---

Through villages small and cities wide,
He wandered, peddling wares with pride.
Fine silks, rare spices, baubles bright,
A charming rogue, a fleeting sight.

Yet beyond the gold exchanged in hand,
He left behind a deeper brand.
For in the barn where secrets keep,
A love was forged—so bittersweet.

The milkmaid wept, the fields stood tall,
A whispered name—now lost to all.
Did Farmer John know? Or never learn
That in his child, the merchant burned?

The seed, untold, yet ever there,
In flaxen curls and knowing stare.
A legacy veiled in fortune's trade,
A truth the merchant never weighed.
