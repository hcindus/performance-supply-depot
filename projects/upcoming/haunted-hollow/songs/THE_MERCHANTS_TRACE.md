# The Merchant's Trace
## Haunted Hollow - Ballad

**Tempo:** Moderate | **Feeling:** Melancholic, nostalgic, wandering

---

He came with silks and spices rare,
With trinkets fine and wares to spare.
His words, a melody of gold,
A tale of lands both new and old.

With measured step and knowing eye,
He traced the paths where fortunes lie.
Yet as he packed his stall away,
Something remained beyond the fray.

Not just the coin, nor cloth unfurled,
But echoes of a broader world—
Of whispered dreams and far-off seas,
Of laughter laced with memories.

For though his wares may fade with time,
His stories live—his soul still chimes.
A merchant, yes—but more than trade,
A wanderer whose mark was made.
