# The Blacksmith's Flame
## Haunted Hollow - Ballad

**Tempo:** Moderate, building | **Feeling:** Passionate, intense, tragic

---

In a quiet village, where whispers roam,
Lived a farmer, his wife, and their humble home.
He toiled the fields from dawn till night,
While she sought warmth in the forge's light.

The blacksmith, strong with arms of steel,
Forged more than iron—he made her feel.
As sparks flew high and embers glowed,
A secret bond between them flowed.

While the farmer plowed the fertile land,
The blacksmith held her willing hand.
In shadows deep, their love did bloom,
A fiery passion that sealed their doom.

For secrets kept in hearts confined,
Are often found by fate unkind.
And though their tale may end in strife,
The forge still whispers of their life.
