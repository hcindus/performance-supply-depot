# The Village Remembers
## Haunted Hollow - Folk Ballad

**Tempo:** Slow, contemplative | **Feeling:** Nostalgic, haunting, bittersweet

---

**[Verse 1]**

We watched the merchant come and go,
With silks and tales in evening's glow.
His whispered words, they lingered long,
A wanderer's heart, a dreamer's song.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the village holds its tales so tight,
In shadows deep, in morning light.
From forge to field, from barn to square,
The stories live—they linger there.

---

**[Verse 2]**

The blacksmith's fire, it burned too bright,
A stolen love in the dead of night.
The farmer knew, yet held his peace,
His quiet strength, a strange release.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the village holds its tales so tight,
In shadows deep, in morning light.
From forge to field, from barn to square,
The stories live—they linger there.

---

**[Bridge]**

And she who rolled through every lane,
The mistress free, who felt no chain,
Her laughter echoes, her secrets bloom,
A fleeting star in the village gloom.

---

**[Outro]**

So raise a glass, let whispers sing,
For every tale the seasons bring.
The village keeps what hearts confess,
A timeless song of tenderness.
