**[Intro]**

Yo, gather round, let me tell you a tale,
Of a village where secrets never go stale,
From the merchant's gold to the blacksmith's flame,
To the rollin' mistress playin' her game—let's go!

---

**[Chorus]**

Rollin', rollin', through the town I glide,
Secrets in the shadows, love I can't hide,
From the market to the fields, I'm spinnin' my fate,
Village tales unfold, yo, we can't escape!

---

**[Verse 1 – The Merchant's Trace]**

I'm the merchant, rollin' in with the spice,
Silks so fine, got the villagers enticed,
Trinkets gleamin', got a story to sell,
Lands far away, yo, I'm ringin' that bell,
My words like gold, they shimmer, they glow,
Tales of the seas where the wild winds blow,
Pack my stall, but I leave somethin' behind,
Echoes of dreams in the hearts that I find,
Not just the coin, but a legacy sown,
A wanderer's mark in the seeds I've grown!

---

**[Chorus]**

Rollin', rollin', through the town I glide,
Secrets in the shadows, love I can't hide,
From the market to the fields, I'm spinnin' my fate,
Village tales unfold, yo, we can't escape!

---

**[Verse 2 – The Merchant's Secret & The Rolling Mistress]**

Met a milkmaid, yeah, her smile so sweet,
In the barn at dusk, where our hearts would meet,
A night of whispers, then I'm ghost on the road,
Left her with a child, but the truth untold,
Flaxen curls and a stare so wise,
My blood in her veins, yo, a merchant's disguise,
But I'm rollin' on, I'm the mistress of the game,
Lovin' all I meet, never feelin' the shame,
From the merchant's arms to the blacksmith's fire,
I'm the rollin' queen, settin' hearts on a pyre!

---

**[Chorus]**

Rollin', rollin', through the town I glide,
Secrets in the shadows, love I can't hide,
From the market to the fields, I'm spinnin' my fate,
Village tales unfold, yo, we can't escape!

---

**[Verse 3 – The Blacksmith's Flame]**

I'm the blacksmith, hammer hittin' with force,
Sparks in the forge, yeah, I'm settin' the course,
Farmer's wife came, lookin' for some heat,
Not just the iron, but a love so sweet,
Embers glowin', our passion ignite,
In the shadows of the forge, we holdin' it tight,
But the farmer's out there, plowin' his land,
Does he know I'm the one holdin' her hand?
Love so fierce, but it's doomed to fall,
Fate's a cruel judge, yo, it's comin' for us all!

---

**[Chorus]**

Rollin', rollin', through the town I glide,
Secrets in the shadows, love I can't hide,
From the market to the fields, I'm spinnin' my fate,
Village tales unfold, yo, we can't escape!

---

**[Verse 4 – The Fool Who Knew]**

I'm the farmer, workin' dawn to the dusk,
Fields in my hands, but my heart's gone bust,
I see the merchant, I see the flame,
I know my wife's playin' a dangerous game,
But I keep it cool, yo, I play the fool,
Silence is my blade, yeah, I'm keepin' it cruel,
Town be whisperin', they call me blind,
But I know every truth that they'll never find,
Plow my earth, let the secrets grow,
I'm the fool who knew—now you know how it go!

---

**[Bridge]**

Village watchin', they laugh, they sigh,
Butcher, baker, tailor, they all wonder why,
I'm rollin' through, like a bike in the street,
Leavin' love and laughter with a rhythm so sweet,
Freedom's my flow, I'm a wandering star,
Dust in my wake, yo, I'm takin' it far!

---

**[Chorus]**

Rollin', rollin', through the town I glide,
Secrets in the shadows, love I can't hide,
From the market to the fields, I'm spinnin' my fate,
Village tales unfold, yo, we can't escape!

---

**[Outro]**

So the village hums, with the tales we weave,
Love and secrets that we'll never leave,
From the merchant's gold to the farmer's grin,
Village tales live on—let the beat begin!
