# Rolling Through the Town
## Haunted Hollow - Country/Folk

**Tempo:** Upbeat, lively | **Feeling:** Free-spirited, playful, rolling

---

**[Verse 1]**

Oh, the town bike rides again,
Through every street, through every bend.
No lock can keep, no road too far,
She's got a heart as wide as the boulevard.

---

**[Chorus]**

Rolling, rolling, never slow,
Where she stops, well, none may know.
Tires may wear, but spirits fly,
The town bike laughs as she rolls by.

---

**[Verse 2]**

The butcher waved, the baker sighed,
The tailor tipped his hat with pride.
She spins her tales, she sings her song,
And keeps the wheels where they belong.

---

**[Bridge]**

Is it freedom, is it fate?
She leaves a mark, won't hesitate.
Love and laughter, never still,
Rolling on, she always will.

---

**[Chorus - Repeat]**

Rolling, rolling, never slow,
Where she stops, well, none may know.
Tires may wear, but spirits fly,
The town bike laughs as she rolls by.

---

**[Outro]**

Some may cheer, some may sigh,
But all will watch as she rides by.
For every town, through dusk and dawn,
The bike keeps rolling on and on!
