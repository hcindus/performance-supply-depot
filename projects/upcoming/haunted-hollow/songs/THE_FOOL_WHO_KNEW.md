# The Fool Who Knew
## Haunted Hollow - Farmer John's Ballad

**Tempo:** Slow, deliberate | **Feeling:** Bittersweet, wise, tragic

---

**[Verse 1]**

The farmer wakes before the sun,
His toil begins, his work hard-won.
Through fields he treads, his hands so strong,
Yet in his heart, he knows what's wrong.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, let them talk, let secrets bloom,
Let laughter echo through the gloom.
I'll plow the earth, I'll sew my grin,
And act as though I've never been.

---

**[Verse 2]**

The merchant came with wares so fine,
A fleeting touch, a night divine.
The blacksmith burned with flames untamed,
Yet still, the husband played his game.

---

**[Bridge]**

For knowing well and standing still,
Is sharper yet than iron's will.
To watch, to wait, to never cry,
To let his love just wander by.

---

**[Verse 3]**

The town will speak, the tavern hum,
They say he's blind, they call him dumb.
Yet he alone holds every truth,
His silence forged, his heart uncouth.

---

**[Outro]**

Oh, let them talk, let secrets bloom,
Let laughter echo through the gloom.
He'll plow the earth, he'll play his part,
The fool who knew—the man so smart.
