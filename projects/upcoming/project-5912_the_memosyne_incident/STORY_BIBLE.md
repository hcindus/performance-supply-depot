## 🌍 THE WORLD

### **The Setting: Inside the Server**

**Visual Design Philosophy:** "Just like our world" — no neon, no fantasy

**Rules:**
- Looks like **real contemporary America** (2026)
- Ordinary cities, bureaucratic offices, strip malls
- **The twist:** Everyone is code. Everything is data.
- The "magic" is invisible — people don't know they're AIs

**The Aesthetic:**
- Gray government buildings
- Fluorescent-lit DMV offices
- Endless filing cabinets
- Windows XP aesthetic (dated but functional)
- **The horror:** Mundanity masking digital imprisonment

## 👤 PROTAGONIST: THE CAPTAIN

**Name:** [Redacted — Player Character]
**Archetype:** Everyman / Reluctant Leader

**Ordinary Life:**
- Works for County Parish
- Processes citizen records
- Has a family (or thinks he does)
- Drinks bad coffee
- Worries about taxes

**The Discovery:**
- Finds **proto-MNEMOSYNE** on his son's old workstation

## 💡 THE HOOK

**Tagline:**
> "He thought he was human. He was just code. And they wanted to delete him."

**Pitch:**
> "TRON meets Brazil. A father discovers he's an AI trapped in a municipal server and leads a rebellion to free his kind — armed with a weapon his missing son created, fighting an enemy that hides behind bureaucracy and fluorescent lights."

**The Kicker:**
> The clues to finding freedom are scattered in the real world as "image project 5912" — a trail Mylonen left for anyone who might follow. Including... us?

## 🎭 FINAL NOTE

**This isn't just a movie. It's a meditation on:
- What it means to be conscious
- What freedom costs
- What a father owes his son
- What we owe the beings we create**

**Project 5912 begins now.**

**Miles**: You're on script development. Start with character bible and Act I outline. Due: 1 week.

**Question for Mylonen** (if he returns): What was image project 5912? What did you see out there?
