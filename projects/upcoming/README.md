## 📂 Active Upcoming Projects

| Project | Codename | Type | Status | Lead | Notes |
|---------|----------|------|--------|------|-------|
| **Da Verse** | da-verse | Game | 📄 Document Drop | TBD | Captain's vision docs here |

## 🎯 How This Works

### For Captain:
1. **Drop documents here** — Upload your ideas, designs, concepts
2. **Commit to GitHub** — Large format supported
3. **Miles and I review** — We prepare for implementation
4. **Promote to active project** — When ready, moves to `projects/[name]/`

### For OpenClaw & Miles:
- **Check here periodically** — New docs may appear
- **Review and summarize** — Capture key concepts
- **Prepare implementation plans** — When Captain gives go-ahead
- **Maintain organization** — Keep files tidy and indexed
