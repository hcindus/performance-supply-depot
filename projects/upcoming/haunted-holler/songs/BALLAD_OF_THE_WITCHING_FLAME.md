# The Ballad of the Witching Flame
## Haunted Hollow - From the Witch's Perspective

**Tempo:** Slow, hypnotic | **Feeling:** Seductive, eerie, tragic

---

**[Intro – Spoken, with a slow, hypnotic banjo pluck]**

I'm the wife in the hollow, with a beauty so rare,
My touch weaves a spell, makes the boldest men stare.
In these mountains so old, where the shadows conspire,
I dance with the darkness, I play with the fire.

---

**[Verse 1 – The Witching Wife's Allure]**

I walk through the glen, where the moon's silver gleams,
My hair like the starlight, my eyes haunt their dreams,
A whisper of magic in the wind's soft caress,
My laughter's a charm, my touch a distress.

The blacksmith, so mighty, his hammer'd sing true,
But he fell to my gaze, like the mornin' dew,
I'd slip to his forge, where the embers burn bright,
His hands sought my warmth in the dead of the night.

Each kiss was a spell, each sigh sealed his fate,
For my love's a curse, born of witchin' hate.

---

**[Chorus – Banjo plays a hypnotic, minor-key melody]**

Oh, my touch is a fire, my beauty a snare,
I'm the witching wife, so deadly, so fair,
The hollow hums low, with a spellbound refrain,
In my web of desire, there's only pain.

---

**[Verse 2 – The Merchant's Doom]**

A merchant came callin', his mule worn and thin,
With silks and sweet spices, and a hunger for sin,
I welcomed him in, with a smile so sly,
My magic took hold, I could see in his eye.

He laid down his wares, but I claimed his soul,
In the firelight's dance, I took full control,
His whispers of love turned to screams in the dark,
For my touch left a chill, left a devil's mark.

I felt John's gaze, through the window's cold glass,
My husband, the watcher, saw the spell I cast.

---

**[Verse 3 – The Farmer's Gaze]**

Oh, John, my ol' man, with his scythe and his plow,
He'd watch from the shadows, I knew somehow,
His eyes burned with hunger, a twisted delight,
He loved seein' me weave my magic at night.

I danced for the blacksmith, I sang for the trade,
But John's silent stare made my powers fade,
His grin grew so wide, like a wolf in the glen,
He fed on my sins, like a beast among men.

I felt the air shift, the mountains grow cold,
My witchcraft was strong, but his darkness took hold.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, my touch is a fire, my beauty a snare,
I'm the witching wife, so deadly, so fair,
The hollow hums low, with a spellbound refrain,
In my web of desire, there's only pain.

---

**[Verse 4 – The Spell Turns Dark]**

The blacksmith grew pale, his strength drained away,
Each night in my arms stole the light of his day,
The merchant's sweet voice turned to ash in his throat,
My magic consumed him, like a mournful note.

I tried to pull back, but the curse was too deep,
The hollow awoke, and the shadows did creep,
The whippoorwill screamed, the cricks turned to blood,
My powers unleashed a dark, endless flood.

Their spirits arose, with their eyes full of flame,
They whispered my name, and they called me to blame.

---

**[Verse 5 – The Witch's Undoing]**

John's laughter rang out, like a bell from the grave,
He'd watched 'til my magic turned me to a slave,
The blacksmith and merchant, their ghosts closed in tight,
Their hands made of bone, in the pale moonlight.

I ran through the hollow, my beauty now gone,
My skin turned to ash, my voice lost its song,
The mountains looked down, with a curse in their stare,
They judged this ol' witch, left her soul bare.

I'm trapped in this glen, a spirit so torn,
A witching wife damned, forever forlorn.

---

**[Bridge – Banjo slows to a dissonant, mournful drone]**

The fog wraps me tight, the shadows won't part,
My magic's a chain 'round my broken heart,
The hollow now echoes with my endless cry,
A witch who bewitched, now doomed to die.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, my touch is a fire, my beauty a snare,
I'm the witching wife, so deadly, so fair,
The hollow hums low, with a spellbound refrain,
In my web of desire, there's only pain.

---

**[Outro – Banjo fades into silence]**

So beware, ye men, when you hear my call,
In the hollow so dark, where the night shadows fall,
My ghost still lingers, my magic's a blight,
I'm the witching wife, a curse in the night.

Don't seek my touch, don't crave my glare,
For I'll steal your soul—I'm the witch so fair.
