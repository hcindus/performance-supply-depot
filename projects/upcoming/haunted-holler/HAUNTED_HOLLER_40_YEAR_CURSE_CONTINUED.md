# ACT I: THE WATCHER'S BURDEN
## John's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

The holler is vibrant, the sun filtering through sycamore trees.

**JOHN**, a young man in his 20s, strong and hopeful, plows the field with a horse-drawn plow. A young woman, **LILA** (the future Wife), in her 20s, with raven-black hair and ethereal beauty, watches from the edge of the field, a mischievous smile on her lips.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Young, earnest)*  
I met her in 1910, a girl with eyes like starlight. She said her name was Lila, and I loved her the moment I saw her. I didn't know she was a witch, or what she'd do to me.

Lila approaches, offering John a cup of water. He drinks, unaware of the potion within. His eyes widen, and he staggers, falling to his knees. She whispers a chant, binding him to her.

**LILA**  
*(Seductively)*  
You're mine now, John. You'll watch, and you'll love me, no matter what I do.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
She bound me with her magic. I couldn't leave her, couldn't stop her. I had to watch—always watchin'.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The cabin is newly built, but already weathered. John, now in his late 20s, works in the field. **LILA**, still radiant, greets a young **MERCHANT**, a wiry man in his 20s with a sly grin, as he arrives with his mule. They laugh, her touch hypnotic.

John watches from the field, his fists clenched, unable to intervene.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
It started with the merchant, back in '15. He'd come every few months, tradin' his goods—and takin' my wife. She loved it, laughin' in his arms while I watched from the shadows.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

Lila, now in her 30s, sits by the fire with **CALEB** the blacksmith, a burly man in his 20s, his arms soot-stained. A young child, about 4 years old, plays nearby—his features strikingly similar to the Merchant's: sharp eyes, sly grin.

John, in his 30s, stands in the doorway, his face etched with pain.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1920, Caleb the blacksmith was comin' 'round too. They didn't care that I saw 'em. And the children… that boy looks like the merchant. Another came in '18, with Caleb's broad shoulders. They ain't mine, but I raise 'em, 'cause I got no choice.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

The cabin is more weathered, the holler darker. Lila, now in her 40s, still beautiful, greets **THE MAYOR**, a pompous man in his 50s, dressed in a fine suit.

A teenage boy (the Caleb-lookalike, age 12) works in the field beside John, now in his 40s, his face lined with years of torment. A younger child, about 5, with the Mayor's sharp nose, plays near the porch.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
The years dragged on, and more men came. The mayor started visitin' in the '20s, leavin' his mark in that boy there. Every child a reminder of what I can't stop. I'm powerless, bound by her spell.

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

John, now in his 50s, graying and stooped, delivers hay to the livery. **THE LIVERY HAND**, a dim-witted man in his 30s, grins stupidly as Lila, still alluring in her 50s, flirts with him behind the stable.

A young girl, about 8, with the Livery Hand's vacant stare, watches from the fence.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand, that fool who can barely handle a horse, had his turn by 1940. Another child, another face that ain't mine. Forty years of this—watchin', hurtin', unable to stop 'em.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The cabin is dilapidated, the holler oppressive. John, now in his 60s, sits on the porch, whittling with a knife, his eyes hollow.

Lila, in her 60s but still striking, greets the Merchant—now in his 60s, his coat more tattered but his grin unchanged.

John watches, his grip on the knife tightening.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1950, I couldn't take no more. The merchant, Caleb, the mayor, the livery hand—they kept comin', and she kept welcomin' 'em. My children—none of 'em mine—stare at me with their fathers' faces. I'm done watchin'.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT II: THE WITCH'S DANCE
## Lila's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

**LILA** (the Wife), young and radiant, watches John plow the field. She holds a vial of potion, her smile cruel.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
*(Seductively, with malice)*  
I was born with magic in my veins, a witch of the holler. John was a simple boy, easy to break. I bound him in 1910, made him watch while I took what I wanted. I love the power—it feeds my soul.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

Lila embraces the Merchant as John watches from the field. She laughs, her pendant glowing.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The merchant came first, in 1915. His silks and spices were a fine trade, but his touch was better. John watched, and I let him. His pain makes my magic stronger.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

Lila sits with Caleb by the fire, the Merchant's son playing nearby. She glances at John in the doorway.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Caleb joined us by 1920, his fire matchin' mine. The children came—little reminders of my power. John raises 'em, but they're mine to claim.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

Lila flirts with the Mayor. The Caleb-lookalike teenager works nearby.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The mayor brought his pride in the '20s, and I took it. Another child, another mark of my magic. But the mountains are watchin', and they don't approve.

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

Lila laughs with the Livery Hand. The girl with his vacant stare watches.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand couldn't resist me by 1940. John's sufferin' is my delight, but I feel the holler turnin' dark.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

Lila welcomes the Merchant again. She senses John on the porch—his presence is heavier than ever.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Forty years, and I'm still the witch of this holler. But John's eyes… they're different now. The mountains whisper judgment.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT III: THE TRADER'S FOLLY
## The Merchant's Perspective, 1915–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY (1915)

The young **MERCHANT** rides his mule through a pass.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
First came in 1915. Found Lila. Been comin' back ever since.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The Merchant meets Lila. John watches.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Her husband watches like a ghost. I take what I want.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

The Merchant sits with Lila, the 4-year-old boy with his features playing nearby.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
By 1920, I saw my face in her boy. I keep comin' back.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1935)

The Merchant's son, now a teenager, eyes him warily.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
My boy's grown, lookin' more like me. John's still watchin', still weak.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The Merchant, now in his 60s, receives tea from John.

**JOHN**  
Care for some tea, traveler?

The Merchant drinks, collapses, dead.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT IV: THE SMITH'S FIRE
## Caleb's Perspective, 1920–1950

**FADE IN:**

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (1920)

**CALEB** hammers iron.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
Met Lila in 1920. I take what I want.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1930)

Caleb visits. The 12-year-old boy with Caleb's build works beside John.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
By 1930, my boy was growin' strong, lookin' like me.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

Caleb sits with Lila. She leaves. John enters with his scythe.

The blade comes down.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT V: THE QUANTUM ECHOES
## Dr. Elena Harper's Perspective, 2025

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLER - DAY (2025)

**DR. ELENA HARPER** sets up camp with her Android tablet and quantum setup.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
I'm here to decode the 40-year curse, 1910 to 1950.

### INT. ELENA'S TENT - DAY

The tablet displays:

```
State: |000⟩ (John 1910), Expected: 1, Predicted: 1
State: |001⟩ (Lila 1910), Expected: 0, Predicted: 1
State: |011⟩ (Merchant 1915), Expected: 0, Predicted: 0
State: |101⟩ (Merchant's son 1916), Expected: 1, Predicted: 0
Final Noise Level: 0.35
```

**ELENA**  
The noise is spiking across decades. The holler's interfering.

The tablet flickers—showing ghostly images of the children. They speak in unison:

**CHILDREN'S SPIRITS**
