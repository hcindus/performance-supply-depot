# ACT I: THE WATCHER'S BURDEN
## John's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

The holler is vibrant, the sun filtering through sycamore trees.

**JOHN**, a young man in his 20s, strong and hopeful, plows the field with a horse-drawn plow. A young woman, **LILA** (the future Wife), in her 20s, with raven-black hair and ethereal beauty, watches from the edge of the field, a mischievous smile on her lips.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Young, earnest)*  
I met her in 1910, a girl with eyes like starlight. She said her name was Lila, and I loved her the moment I saw her. I didn't know she was a witch, or what she'd do to me.

Lila approaches, offering John a cup of water. He drinks, unaware of the potion within. His eyes widen, and he staggers, falling to his knees. She whispers a chant, binding him to her.

**LILA**  
*(Seductively)*  
You're mine now, John. You'll watch, and you'll love me, no matter what I do.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
She bound me with her magic. I couldn't leave her, couldn't stop her. I had to watch—always watchin'.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The cabin is newly built, but already weathered. John, now in his late 20s, works in the field. **LILA**, still radiant, greets a young **MERCHANT**, a wiry man in his 20s with a sly grin, as he arrives with his mule. They laugh, her touch hypnotic.

John watches from the field, his fists clenched, unable to intervene.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
It started with the merchant, back in '15. He'd come every few months, tradin' his goods—and takin' my wife. She loved it, laughin' in his arms while I watched from the shadows.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

Lila, now in her 30s, sits by the fire with **CALEB** the blacksmith, a burly man in his 20s, his arms soot-stained. A young child, about 4 years old, plays nearby—his features strikingly similar to the Merchant's: sharp eyes, sly grin.

John, in his 30s, stands in the doorway, his face etched with pain.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1920, Caleb the blacksmith was comin' 'round too. They didn't care that I saw 'em. And the children… that boy looks like the merchant. Another came in '18, with Caleb's broad shoulders. They ain't mine, but I raise 'em, 'cause I got no choice.

*CLOSE ON: The boy's face—undeniably the Merchant's features. John's pain is palpable.*

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

The cabin is more weathered, the holler darker. Lila, now in her 40s, still beautiful, greets **THE MAYOR**, a pompous man in his 50s, dressed in a fine suit.

A teenage boy (resembling Caleb, age 12) works in the field beside John, now in his 40s, his face lined with years of torment. A younger child, about 5, with the Mayor's sharp nose, plays near the porch.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
The years dragged on, and more men came. The mayor started visitin' in the '20s, leavin' his mark in that boy there. Every child a reminder of what I can't stop. I'm powerless, bound by her spell.

*The Caleb-lookalike teenager glances at John—there's no resemblance between them. John looks away, heartbroken.*

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

John, now in his 50s, graying and stooped, delivers hay to the livery. **THE LIVERY HAND**, a dim-witted man in his 30s, grins stupidly as Lila, still alluring in her 50s, flirts with him behind the stable.

A young girl, about 8, with the Livery Hand's vacant stare, watches from the fence.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand, that fool who can barely handle a horse, had his turn by 1940. Another child, another face that ain't mine. Forty years of this—watchin', hurtin', unable to stop 'em.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The cabin is dilapidated, the holler oppressive. John, now in his 60s, sits on the porch, whittling with a knife, his eyes hollow.

Lila, in her 60s but still striking, greets the Merchant—now in his 60s, his coat more tattered but his grin unchanged. John watches, his grip on the knife tightening.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1950, I couldn't take no more. The merchant, Caleb, the mayor, the livery hand—they kept comin', and she kept welcomin' 'em. My children—none of 'em mine—stare at me with their fathers' faces. I'm done watchin'.

*CLOSE ON: John's eyes—40 years of pain crystallizing into madness.*

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT II: THE WITCH'S DANCE
## Lila's Perspective, 1910–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1910)

**LILA** (the Wife), young and radiant, watches John plow the field. She holds a vial of potion, her smile cruel.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
*(Seductively, with malice)*  
I was born with magic in my veins, a witch of the holler. John was a simple boy, easy to break. I bound him in 1910, made him watch while I took what I wanted. I love the power—it feeds my soul.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

Lila, still youthful, embraces the Merchant as John watches from the field. She laughs, her pendant glowing faintly with a greenish light.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The merchant came first, in 1915. His silks and spices were a fine trade, but his touch was better. John watched, and I let him. His pain makes my magic stronger.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

Lila, in her 30s, sits with Caleb by the fire, the Merchant's son playing nearby. She glances at John in the doorway, her smile triumphant.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Caleb joined us by 1920, his fire matchin' mine. The children came—little reminders of my power. John raises 'em, but they're mine to claim, just like their fathers.

*The boy with Merchant's face looks up at Lila—he smiles the same sly grin.*

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

Lila, in her 40s, flirts with the Mayor. The Caleb-lookalike teenager works nearby. The Mayor's son plays on the porch, his sharp nose unmistakable.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The mayor brought his pride in the '20s, and I took it from him. Another child, another mark of my magic. The holler hums with my power, but the mountains are watchin', and they don't approve.

*She feels a chill wind—a warning she ignores.*

### EXT. TOWN LIVERY - DAY (1940)

Lila, in her 50s, laughs with the Livery Hand behind the stable. The girl with his vacant stare watches from the fence.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Even the livery hand, that simpleton, couldn't resist me by 1940. I take what I want, and I love bein' wanted. John's sufferin' is my delight, but I feel the holler turnin' dark.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

Lila, in her 60s but still alluring, welcomes the Merchant again, her laughter echoing. She senses John on the porch, his presence heavier than ever.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Forty years, and I'm still the witch of this holler. But John's eyes… they're different now. The mountains whisper judgment, and I fear my magic's gone too far.

*She glances nervously at the ridge—she feels something watching, ancient and angry.*

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT III: THE TRADER'S FOLLY
## The Merchant's Perspective, 1915–1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY (1915)

The young **MERCHANT**, in his 20s, rides his mule through a pass, his sack of goods clinking. He hums, his eyes sharp.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
*(Charming, greedy)*  
I first came to this holler in 1915, hearin' tales of a woman fairer'n any jewel. I found her—Lila—and I've been comin' back ever since.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The Merchant meets Lila. He drapes a silk over her shoulders, her touch intoxicating. John watches from the field, powerless.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Her husband's a fool, watchin' us like a ghost. I take what I want, and she loves givin' it. I don't care if he sees—I've been doin' this for years.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1920)

The Merchant, in his 30s, sits with Lila, the 4-year-old boy with his features playing nearby. John watches from the doorway, his pain palpable.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
By 1920, I saw my own face in her boy. She's a witch, sure enough, but I don't mind. I keep comin' back, sharin' her with that blacksmith now.

*The boy looks at the Merchant—there's a strange recognition in his eyes.*

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1935)

The Merchant, in his 40s, arrives again, his mule older, his goods more worn. Lila, still beautiful, welcomes him. The Merchant's son, now a teenager, eyes him warily from the field.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
The years pass, but Lila don't change. My boy's grown, lookin' more like me every day. John's still watchin', still weak. I take what I want, always will.

*Teenage Merchant-son and his father lock eyes—neither acknowledges the resemblance, but it's undeniable.*

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The Merchant, now in his 60s, sits with Lila by the fire, as seen in Act I. John offers tea, his smile chilling.

**JOHN**  
*(Calmly, with a chilling smile)*  
Care for some tea, traveler? It's a cold night out there.

**MERCHANT**  
*(Cocky)*  
Much obliged, farmer. Forty years, and you're still pourin' tea for your guests.

John's eyes darken. The Merchant drinks, oblivious.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Forty years, and I'm still here, takin' what's mine. But this tea… it's bitter. My head's spinnin'—

The Merchant slumps, dead, his face frozen in shock.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT IV: THE SMITH'S FIRE
## Caleb's Perspective, 1920–1950

**FADE IN:**

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (1920)

**CALEB**, a young blacksmith in his 20s, hammers iron, the forge roaring. Lila enters, her presence electric.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Gruff, proud)*  
I met Lila in 1920, and I couldn't resist her. She's a witch, but I don't care. I take what I want, even if her man's watchin'.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DUSK (1920)

Lila and Caleb embrace, John watching from the ridge. Caleb smirks, defiant.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
John's up there, always watchin'. Let him. The merchant's been here too—we share her, and she loves it.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1930)

Caleb, in his 30s, visits the cabin, Lila welcoming him. The 12-year-old boy with Caleb's broad shoulders works beside John, who glares at Caleb with silent rage.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
By 1930, my boy was growin' strong, lookin' like me. John raises him, but he's mine. I keep comin' back, year after year, takin' what's mine.

*The boy looks at Caleb—there's strength in his shoulders, same build, same soot-stained hands despite working the fields.*

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1945)

Caleb, in his 40s, and Lila, still alluring, laugh by the forge. The holler feels darker, the air heavier. John's silhouette on the ridge is a constant presence.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
The years don't stop us. Lila's magic keeps her beautiful, and I keep comin'. John's sufferin' don't mean nothin' to me.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

Caleb, now in his 50s, sits with Lila, exhausted. She leaves, her silhouette disappearing into the night.

Caleb looks toward the ridge, expecting to see John's silhouette as always. But tonight—nothing.

He rises, alarmed. A shadow looms in the doorway. It's John, holding his scythe, his eyes wild with 40 years of madness.

**CALEB**  
John… after all these years—

The scythe comes down with a sickening **THUD**.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Fading, horrified)*  
John… you… bastard…

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT V: THE QUANTUM ECHOES
## Dr. Elena Harper's Perspective, 2025

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLER - DAY (2025)

The holler is overgrown, the cabin and forge ruins barely visible beneath vines and moss. The air is heavy, the wind carrying faint whispers.

**DR. ELENA HARPER**, a researcher in her 30s, sets up camp. She has a laptop, a portable battery, and an **Android tablet running DroidScript**.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
*(Curious, analytical)*  
I'm Dr. Elena Harper, a quantum computing researcher. The legends of this holler speak of a 40-year tale of betrayal and murder, from 1910 to 1950—a witch, her bound husband, their children born of other men. I'm here to decode the echoes, using quantum states to uncover the truth across time.

### INT. ELENA'S TENT - DAY

Elena runs a 3-qubit circuit on IBM Quantum via her laptop, transferring the data to her tablet. The DroidScript app displays the simulation:

```
Initial State: |000⟩
State Vector: [0.71, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.71, 0.00]
Measured State: |000⟩
```

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The states encode the 40-year story:
- |000⟩ for John's torment (1910-1950)
- |001⟩ for Lila's witchcraft (40 years of seduction)
- |010⟩ for Caleb's visits (1920-1950)
- |011⟩ for the Merchant's visits (1915-1950)
- |100⟩ for the holler's judgment
- |101⟩, |110⟩, |111⟩ for the children—the echoes across generations

The tablet flickers, the noise level rising. The wind outside howls, whispers growing louder.

**ELENA**  
*(Alarmed)*  
What the—? The noise is spiking—my OODA loop can adjust for hardware error, but this isn't normal. It's like the holler's interfering, mixing the perspectives across the decades.

Elena trains the NN, the app displaying:

```
State: |000⟩ (1910-John), Expected: 1, Predicted: 1
State: |001⟩ (1910-Lila), Expected: 0, Predicted: 1
State: |011⟩ (1915-Merchant), Expected: 0, Predicted: 0
State: |101⟩ (1916-Merchant's son), Expected: 1, Predicted: 0
State: |010⟩ (1920-Caleb), Expected: 0, Predicted: 1
State: |110⟩ (1918-Caleb's son), Expected: 0, Predicted: 1
Final Noise Level: 0.28
```

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The data's corrupted across decades—John's binding in 1910, Lila's affairs through the '20s and '30s, the children born in '16, '18, '25, '32… I hear whispers—multiple voices, generations overlapping. The Merchant's sly laugh, Caleb's hammer, children's laughter, John's ragged breathing.

The screen flickers violently, showing **FLASHING IMAGES**:
- 1910: Young John, hopeful, meeting Lila
- 1916: Baby with Merchant's eyes
- 1920: Caleb entering the cabin
- 1932: Girl with Livery Hand's vacant stare
- 1950: John, aged and hollow, holding the scythe

**ELENA (Shaken)**  
The holler's state—|100⟩—it's taking over the simulation. Forty years of curse condensed into quantum noise. I need to stop—

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT

Elena sits by a campfire, the tablet on her lap. The app displays a **timeline visualization**—the quantum states forming a chronological story across 40 years.

**THE SCREEN SHOWS:**
- 1910-1950: John's descending line (|000⟩ amplitude decreasing)
- Interwoven affairs: Merchant (|011⟩), Caleb (|010⟩), Mayor, Livery Hand
- The children as hybrid states (|101⟩, |110⟩)
- Lila's power growing then plateauing (|001⟩)
- The holler's judgment building (|100⟩ rising)

The whispers form words: **"You shouldn't have come… the children remember…"**

**ELENA**  
*(To herself)*  
John watched for 40 years—forty years of children who weren't his, growing up with their fathers' faces. The simulation's showing me his breaking point in 1950. But why is the noise getting stronger?

The tablet emits a **distorted hum**, and suddenly:
- **The Merchant's son** (would be 108 if alive) appears as a translucent spirit, his sly grin aged but unmistakable
- **Caleb's son** manifests, broad shoulders visible even in ghost-form
- **The Mayor's son**, sharp nose prominent
- **The Livery Hand's daughter**, vacant stare now haunting

**CHILDREN'S SPIRITS (in unison):**  
*
