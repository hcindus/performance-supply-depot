# ACT I: THE WATCHER'S BURDEN
## John's Perspective, 1950

**FADE IN:**

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1950)

The cabin is small, made of weathered logs, with a dirt floor and a single window. A rusty scythe leans against the wall. The air is heavy with the scent of earth and woodsmoke.

**JOHN**, a gaunt man in his 40s with a weathered face and piercing eyes, sits at a rough-hewn table, sipping coffee from a tin mug. His movements are slow, deliberate, but his eyes dart toward the window, always watching.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Gravelly, with a hint of obsession)*  
They call me simple, a farmer with nothin' but dirt in my hands. But I see more'n they think. I see her—my wife—slippin' through the glen like a fox in the night. And I watch.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY

John plows the field with a horse-drawn plow, the sun beating down. He pauses, wiping sweat from his brow, and looks toward the ridge where the **BLACKSMITH'S FORGE** sits, smoke rising from its chimney. His expression hardens.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
She thinks I don't know where she goes. To that forge, to Caleb's arms. I've seen 'em, in the glow of the embers, laughin' like I don't exist. But I watch. Always watchin'.

### EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE FORGE - DUSK

John crouches behind a pine tree, his breath shallow, his eyes gleaming with a mix of rage and fascination. Below, the forge glows with a fiery light. The **WIFE**, a striking woman in her 30s with long, raven-black hair and a hypnotic presence, laughs as she embraces **CALEB**, the blacksmith, a burly man with soot-stained arms.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Whispering, almost to himself)*  
Her laughter's a spell, bindin' him to her. But it binds me too. I can't look away. I don't want to.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The moon hangs low, casting a pale light over the holler. John sits on the porch, whittling a piece of wood with a knife. The sound of a mule's hooves echoes in the distance. He looks up, his eyes narrowing.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
Another man's comin'. I can feel it in the air. The holler's whisperin'—a new fool for her to claim.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (LATER)

The **MERCHANT**, a wiry man in his 40s with a tattered coat and a sly grin, ties his mule to a post. He carries a sack of goods—silks and spices. The Wife steps onto the porch, her eyes lighting up with a dangerous allure.

**WIFE**  
*(Seductively)*  
You're a long way from the lowlands, traveler. What brings you to this lonesome holler?

**MERCHANT**  
*(Charming, with a wink)*  
Heard there's beauty in these hills, ma'am. And I reckon I've just found it.

John watches from the shadows of the porch, his knife still in hand. His grin widens, but his eyes are cold, unblinking.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
He don't know what he's walkin' into. She'll take him, like she takes 'em all. And I'll watch. I always watch.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Merchant and the Wife sit by the fire, laughing softly. John stands in the doorway, unnoticed, his shadow long and menacing. The Merchant's hand brushes the Wife's arm, and she leans closer, her laughter like a melody. John's grip on the knife tightens, but he doesn't move.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
They think I'm blind. They think I'm weak. But I see everythin'. And soon, they'll see me.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - LATER

The fire has died to embers. The Merchant lies collapsed on a pallet, unconscious, wine glass still in hand. The Wife strokes his hair, humming softly.

**WIFE**  
*(to herself, satisfied)*  
Another one added to the collection.

John steps into the light. His eyes are hollow, his face a mask of decades of torment.

**JOHN**  
How many more, Lila? How many more men before you've had enough?

The Wife doesn't flinch. She smiles.

**WIFE**  
You know you'll never stop me, John. You're bound to me. You'll always watch.

**JOHN**  
*(voice cracking)*  
I've watched for 35 years. Since you first came to this holler. Since you poured that potion down my throat and bound me to your heart.

**WIFE**  
And a good husband you've been. Watching. Waiting. Wishing you could have what they have.

She stands, approaching him. Her hand cups his face.

**WIFE (CONT'D)**  
But you can't. You'll never be able to. That's your curse, John. To want what you can never have.

John's jaw clenches. A tear tracks down his weathered cheek.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
35 years. 35 years of watchin' her with other men. The merchant, the blacksmith, the mayor, the livery hand. All of 'em comin' to her. All of 'em leavin' marks on children that ain't mine.

**JOHN**  
*(barely a whisper)*  
I want to die.

**WIFE**  
*(smiling)*  
You will. But not yet. You haven't fulfilled your purpose yet.

She exits into the bedroom. The Merchant snores.

John looks at the knife in his hand. Then at the scythe on the wall.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
35 years of watchin'. 35 years of waitin'. And I've finally stopped feelin'.

He picks up the scythe. It's heavier than he remembers.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT II: THE WITCH'S DANCE
## The Wife's Perspective, 1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1910)

The scene opens in a brighter time, 40 years before. The **WIFE**, younger—**LILA**—in her 20s, stands by a sycamore tree, her raven hair catching the sunlight. She watches John plow the field, a mischievous smile on her lips. She holds a small vial of dark liquid—a potion.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
*(Seductively, with a hint of malice)*  
I was a maiden of the holler, with magic in my veins. I saw John, so plain, so pure, and I wanted to break him. So I wove a spell, to bind him to me forever.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1910, CONTINUOUS)

Lila approaches John, offering him a cup of water. He drinks, unaware of the potion mixed within. His eyes widen, and he staggers, falling to his knees. She kneels beside him, whispering a chant in an ancient tongue. His gaze locks onto hers, filled with a mix of love and torment.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
I bound him to my heart, but I'd never give him my touch. He'd watch me with others, crave what he'd never have. That was my curse—his eternal torment.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1915)

Lila, now in her 20s, sits on the porch when the **MERCHANT** arrives on his mule. She rises, smoothing her dress, her eyes gleaming with predatory interest.

**MERCHANT**  
Good day, ma'am. Traveler passing through, lookin' for a place to rest.

**LILA**  
*(hypnotically)*  
You've found it.

She walks toward him. The Merchant's eyes go glassy. He dismounts, following her inside.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The merchant was first, in 1915. Such a willing soul. He came back every few months, leavin' pieces of himself with me.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 1915)

Lila and the Merchant lie together by the dying fire. John stands in the corner, watching, his fists clenched.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
And John watched. That was the beauty of the spell—he *had* to watch. He couldn't look away, no matter how much he wanted to.

**MERCHANT**  
*(lazily)*  
Your husband's a patient man, ma'am.

**LILA**  
He's learned to be.

John's eye twitches.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1920)

A young boy, about 4 years old, plays in the yard. He's got sharp eyes—a mirror of the Merchant's.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
1916 brought the first child. The Merchant's son. I let John raise him, pretend he was his. But the boy knew. The boy *always* knew.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1920)

Lila approaches **CALEB**, the blacksmith, as he works. She watches the play of muscles under his shirt, the fire casting shadows on her face.

**CALEB**  
Morning, ma'am. What brings you to the forge?

**LILA**  
*(leaning close)*  
You. I've been watching you work. Such strong hands.

Caleb's hammer slows. His breath catches.

**CALEB**  
*(dazed)*  
I... uh...

**LILA**  
Come see me tonight. When the fire dies down.

She leaves. Caleb stands frozen, hammer mid-air.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
Caleb joined in 1920. Such fire in him. It matched my own.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (1930)

John, now in his 40s, works the plow. The field is barren, the soil exhausted. His son—**CALEB'S BOY**, now 12—works beside him. The boy has broad shoulders, soot-stained even without working at the forge.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
By 1930, there were four children. None mine. All raised by me. All reminders of what I couldn't have.

**CALEB'S BOY**  
Papa, I'm tired.

**JOHN**  
*(coldly)*  
Keep workin'.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The children grew, each bearing their father's marks. The Merchant's sharp eyes. Caleb's broad shoulders. The Mayor's pompous nose. The Livery Hand's vacant stare.

### EXT. TOWN - DAY (1935)

Lila walks through town, now in her 40s but still ethereal, still beautiful. The **MAYOR** notices her, tipping his hat.

**MAYOR**  
Mrs. Hart. Looking lovely as always.

**LILA**  
*(captivating)*  
Mayor. How kind of you to notice.

She touches his arm. He shivers.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
The Mayor started visiting in the '20s. Then the Livery Hand in the '40s. Each one adding to my collection. Each one leaving a piece behind.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

Lila—now aged but still retaining an unsettling beauty—sits alone in the cabin. The fire is low.

She holds a small vial—the same potion she gave John 40 years ago. But this time, she's drinking it herself.

**LILA (V.O.)**  
By 1950, I had drained them all. The magic took more than it gave. And now... now I'm tired.

She drinks. Her eyes flutter.

**LILA (CONT'D)**  
*(slurring)*  
40 years of power. 40 years of taking. But the holler... the holler wants more.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

Lila collapses. The door crashes open. John stands there, the scythe in his hands, his eyes completely hollow.

**LILA**  
*(weakened)*  
John...

**JOHN**  
40 years, Lila. 40 years I've watched you destroy everything I ever wanted.

He raises the scythe.

**LILA**  
*(smiling, even now)*  
You can't kill me, John. I'm already dead. I've been dead since the day I bound you.

**JOHN**  
Then I'll send you to hell.

**LILA**  
This IS hell, John. Don't you understand? We never left.

The scythe comes down.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT III: THE TRADER'S FOLLY
## The Merchant's Perspective, 1915-1950

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY (1915)

The **MERCHANT**, a young man in his 20s with a sharp mind and sharper eyes, rides his mule through the Appalachian hills. He carries silks, spices, and gadgets from the lowlands.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
*(Narrating, older now)*  
I'm a trader. Been crossin' these hills for 20 years. Never stayed anywhere long. Never attached to anythin'. That's the merchant's life—keep movin', keep sellin', keep your heart in your saddlebag.

### EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE HOLLER - DAY (1915)

The Merchant pauses, looking down into a secluded valley—a holler, hidden from the main road.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
But in 1915, I found a holler that changed everythin'. A place I kept comin' back to, no matter how hard I tried to stay away.

Below, he sees a woman—young Lila—standing in a field. She's beautiful in a way that's not quite human.

**MERCHANT (CONT'D)**  
And a woman who changed me. Against my will. Against my nature. Against everythin' I believed about myself.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1915)

The Merchant arrives, tying his mule to a post. Lila emerges on the porch, her eyes lighting up.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
I told myself: one night. That's all. Then move on.

**WIFE**  
Traveler. You've come a long way.

**MERCHANT**  
Just passin' through, ma'am. Restock supplies, maybe sell some goods.

**WIFE**  
*(moving closer)*  
I'm sure there's something here you need.

The Merchant's resolve crumbles.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
I told myself that every time. For 35 years.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1916)

The Merchant, now in his 30s, sits by the fire. Lila strokes his hair. A baby cries in the next room.

**WIFE**  
The boy's yours. I want you to know that.

**MERCHANT**  
*(shocked)*  
What?

**WIFE**  
I kept him. For you. So you'd always come back.

The Merchant stares at the baby—his son—with sharp, knowing eyes.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
She had me. Body and soul. And she used my own child to keep me tied.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (1930)

The Merchant, now in his 50s, returns. Older, more weathered, but still drawn to the holler like a moth to flame.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
I came back. Every few months. Couldn't stop myself. She'd call, and I'd come runnin'. Like a dog to a whistle.

His son—now 14, sharp eyes—works in the field with John.

**MERCHANT (CONT'D)**  
And every time, I'd see my boy. See him grow into a man I could never be a father to. See John raisin' him. See what I could never have.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The Merchant, now elderly, arrives one last time. His mule is tired. His coat is tattered. But his eyes still light up when he sees Lila on the porch.

**WIFE**  
You've come back.

**MERCHANT**  
Always do. Always will.

**WIFE**  
This is the last time, isn't it?

**MERCHANT**  
Probably.

**WIFE**  
Good. I'm tired.

She takes his hand. Leads him inside.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
I should have known. When she said she was tired—that meant it was over. For me. For all of us.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

The Merchant lies on the pallet, weakened, sweat beading on his forehead. Lila sits beside him, a cup in her hand.

**MERCHANT**  
What... what's in this?

**WIFE**  
Something to help you rest.

**MERCHANT**  
*(realizing)*  
You poisonin' me?

**WIFE**  
*(smiling)*  
I'm giving you what you wanted. Me. Forever.

The Merchant tries to rise, but his limbs won't cooperate. He collapses, his eyes wide with realization.

**MERCHANT**  
No... no!

His body goes still.

**WIFE**  
*(petting his hair)*  
Now you're mine. Like all the others.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT IV: THE SMITH'S FIRE
## The Blacksmith's Perspective, 1920-1950

**FADE IN:**

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (1920)

The forge is a cavernous space, filled with the glow of a roaring fire. **CALEB**, a burly man in his 20s with soot-stained arms and a proud bearing, hammers a piece of iron, his movements powerful and rhythmic. The air is thick with heat and the scent of molten metal.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Gruff, with a hint of pride)*  
I'm Caleb, the smith of this holler. Strongest man in these hills. I forge iron into somethin' useful. But there's one thing I can't resist—her.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DUSK (1920)

Lila approaches, as she did in Act II. Caleb looks up, his hammer pausing mid-strike. Her beauty captivates him, and he drops the hammer, stepping toward her.

**CALEB**  
*(Dazed, under her spell)*  
You're back, ma'am. Can't stay away from the fire, can you?

**WIFE**  
*(Seductively)*  
It's your fire I'm after, Caleb. Keeps me warm in ways the holler can't.

Caleb glances toward the ridge, spotting John's silhouette in the pines. He smirks, defiant.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
John's up there, watchin' us like a hawk. Let him watch. I've shared her with others—the merchant got his turn. We take what we want, and John's got what he's got.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1920)

Caleb and Lila embrace, the fire casting flickering shadows. Each touch from her drains a faint glow from his skin, but he's too enthralled to notice.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
Her touch is a fire, hotter'n my forge. But I'm feelin' weaker each time she comes 'round. Don't matter—I'll keep takin' what's mine.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY (1930)

Caleb, now in his 30s, works at the anvil. But his movements are slower now. Weaker. His son—**YOUNG CALEB**, about 12—watches from the doorway.

**CALEB'S BOY**  
Papa, let me help.

**CALEB**  
*(breathless)*  
Not yet, boy. You're not strong enough.

**CALEB'S BOY**  
I will be. Someday.

Caleb looks at his son. Sees himself. Sees Lila.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
He looks like me. But his eyes... his eyes are hers. Possessed. Hungry.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

Caleb, now in his 50s, sits by the dying embers. His face is pale, his body wasted. The fire that once roared now barely gutters.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
50 years I've been burnin' for her. And now the fire's about to go out.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

The door crashes open. John stands there, scythe raised, eyes hollow.

**CALEB**  
*(weakly)*  
John? What—

**JOHN**  
It's over, Caleb.

**CALEB**  
*(realizing)*  
She sent you? After all these years, she finally sent you?

**JOHN**  
No one sent me. I came for myself. For 30 years of watchin' you take what I couldn't have.

**CALEB**  
*(trying to rise, failing)*  
You can't... I'm stronger than...

**JOHN**  
You're weak, Caleb. Just like the rest of us. She drained us all.

The scythe falls. Blood splatters the forge.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(final whisper)*  
The fire's out.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT V: THE QUANTUM ECHOES
## Dr. Elena Harper's Perspective, 2025

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY (2025)

A sleek black SUV winds through Appalachian hills. Signs point to obscure destinations.

**INT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS**

**DR. ELENA HARPER**, 30s, brilliant physicist with tired eyes and a haunted expression, drives. In the passenger seat: a rugged **TABLET** with quantum computing hardware. In the back: camping gear, research equipment.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
*(Narrating)*  
I'm a quantum physicist. MIT. Caltech. A dozen publications on quantum state simulation. But none of that prepared me for what I found in these hills.

### EXT. ABANDONED HOLLER - DAY (2025)

Elena emerges from the SUV at a clearing. Ruins: a collapsed cabin, a rusted forge, overgrow fields. The holler is silent, oppressive.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
Local legend says people lived here until 1950. Then one night... everyone disappeared. Farmer, blacksmith, merchant. Even the children.

She approaches the ruins, tablet in hand.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
The quantum simulations showed anomalies in this location. States that shouldn't exist. Superpositions that collapsed into nothing.

### INT. ELENA'S CAMP - NIGHT (2025)

Elena sets up equipment. Multiple quantum sensors, a portable superconductor, the tablet running complex simulations.

The screen displays quantum states: |000⟩ |001⟩ |010⟩ |011⟩ |100⟩...

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The locals call this place cursed. I call it the most significant quantum anomaly I've ever encountered.

The tablet buzzes. State changes: |010⟩ → |101⟩ → |011⟩.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
It's like the memory of this place is encoded in quantum states. Still here. Still existing. 75 years later.

### EXT. RUINS OF FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (2025)

Elena digs through debris. Finds: a rusted scythe, a broken mirror, a child's toy.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
I found records in county archives. A farmer named John, his wife Lila, several children. None of them had birth certificates. None of them had death certificates. They just... stopped existing in 1950.

She picks up an old photograph—faded, damaged, but visible: John, Lila, and four children.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
Four children. All different fathers, according to local gossip. And all vanished on the same night.

### INT. ELENA'S CAMP - NIGHT (2025)

The tablet displays complex quantum equations. Elena studies them, frustrated.

**ELENA**  
*(muttering)*  
The math doesn't make sense. States shouldn't persist this long. Memory decay should have collapsed everything by now.

The screen flickers. States begin rapid oscillation: |000⟩ |001⟩ |010⟩ |011⟩ |100⟩ |101⟩ |110⟩ |111⟩. All eight states simultaneously.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
What the...

She tries to adjust parameters. The system resists.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
Something's fighting my simulations. Something doesn't want to be observed.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (2025)

Elena walks through the holler, tablet in hand. The air is thick, oppressive. The trees seem to lean in.

The screen shows increasing noise levels: 0.15 → 0.32 → 0.51 → 0.78 → 0.99.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
The quantum noise is rising. In a coherent system, this would destroy the simulation. But here... it's like the noise is part of the signal.

### EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE FORGE - NIGHT (2025)

Elena stands where John once stood. Below, the ruined forge seems to glow faintly.

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
I thought I was observing the past. But now I think... the past is observing me.

Her tablet screen goes dark. Then displays: |100⟩

**ELENA**  
*(reading)*  
State |100⟩... that's the Holler state. That's not even in my model.

Text appears on screen: **WHO ARE YOU?**

Elena drops the tablet.

**ELENA**  
*(whispering)*  
Oh God.

### EXT. RUINS OF FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (2025)

Elena scrambles back to camp, grabbing the tablet. The screen is filled with overlapping images:

- 1910: Young John and Lila
- 1916: Baby with Merchant's eyes
- 1920: Caleb with Lila
- 1930: Mayor visits
- 1940: Livery Hand's daughter
- 1950: The massacre

**ELENA (V.O.)**  
It's showing me everything. All 40 years. All simultaneously. Like the quantum states collapsed into the same moment.

Ghost-like figures begin manifesting—John, Lila, the Merchant, Caleb, the children. All of them. All watching her.

**ELENA**  
*(screaming)*  
STOP! I didn't mean to disturb you!

**CHILDREN'S SPIRITS (in unison, hauntingly):**  
*You shouldn't have come… our fathers used our mother… we never belonged to him…*

**ELENA**  
I'll leave! I'll go! Just let me—

The ground trembles. Roots burst from the earth, wrapping around her legs.

**ELENA (CONT'D)**  
NO!

She's dragged toward the abyss. The tablet screen shatters, frozen on |111⟩.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - DAWN (2025)

Silent. Empty camp. Cracked tablet on the ground.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
*(Deep, ancient, resonant)*  
She's mine now. Like the others. Across the centuries. The mountains always win.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

# ACT VI: THE HOLLER'S JUDGMENT
## The Holler's Perspective, All of Time

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (1950)

The holler is dark, the moon **blood-red**. Wind howls through sycamores.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
*(Deep, ancient, resonant)*  
I am the holler. Witness to 40 years of sin. From 1910 to 1950, I watched Lila bewitch John, drawin' men to her bed—the merchant, the blacksmith, the mayor, the livery hand. Her children, born of betrayal, filled this land with pain. John watched, powerless, 'til his madness took over.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (1950)

John stands over Caleb's body, scythe dripping blood. Forge embers flicker.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
The smith fell first, in his own forge. Iron fitting for a man of fire.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (1950)

John strides through woods, scythe gleaming. The Merchant's body lies inside, face frozen. Lila sleeps.

John enters. Lila stirs.

**LILA**  
*(Alarmed)*  
John? What's that noise—

Scythe comes down. Blood splatters walls.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
The witch thought her magic'd save her. But her spell on John turned against her. She denied him too long.

### EXT. RIDGETOP - NIGHT (1950)

John, covered in blood, walks toward town. The **CHILDREN**—now adults aged 18-34—flee into woods, their faces haunting: Merchant's son's sly grin, Caleb's son's broad shoulders, Mayor's son's sharp nose, the daughter's vacant stare.

John pursues. One by one, they fall.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
The children fled, but John followed. Their fathers' faces didn't save 'em. He was beyond savin'.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (1950)

John stands alone among the bodies. The spirits of Lila, Caleb, the Merchant rise—translucent, twisted, surrounding him with ghostly hands.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
I claimed 'em in 1950, their souls trapped in my depths. But the curse lingered, a stain on this land.

The ground opens. John is pulled down, laughing madly as he descends into darkness.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (2025)

The cabin and forge are swallowed by earth. Only ruins remain.

**Elena** stands by her dead campfire, tablet on the ground. The screen glows with **|100⟩**.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
Now, in 2025, this woman seeks my secrets with her machines. She thinks her science can unravel my curse.

The tablet displays corrupted data—generations overlapping:
- 1910: Young John and Lila
- 1916: Baby with Merchant's eyes
- 1920: Caleb with Lila
- 1930: Mayor visits
- 1932: Livery Hand's daughter born
- 1950: Rampage

Ghosts materialize—**MULTIPLE GENERATIONS** of the cursed family:
- John, aged and hollow
- Lila, still alluring even in death
- The Merchant and Caleb, eternally young
- **THE CHILDREN'S SPIRITS**: Their adult forms, still bearing their fathers' features

**ELENA**  
*(Screaming)*  
Stop! I didn't mean to disturb—

**CHILDREN'S SPIRITS (in unison, hauntingly):**  
*You shouldn't have come… our fathers used our mother… we never belonged to him…*

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
I let her see the tale—all 40 years, 4 children's faces, endless torment. I twisted it with my noise. Her machine can't fight my curse.

The ground trembles. The spirits are sucked into the earth—**all generations, all timelines collapsing**.

Elena scrambles to escape. Roots burst from ground, wrap her legs. She is dragged into abyss as the tablet shatters, screen frozen on **|111⟩**.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - DAWN (2025)

Silent. Empty camp. Cracked tablet on ground.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
They're all mine now—the farmer, the witch, the smith, the trader, the children, and now the seeker with her machine. Across the centuries. The mountains always win.

## EPILOGUE: THE OBSERVER'S GAZE

### EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY (2025 - LATER)

A car drives past the holler. The driver—**RANGER DAVIS**—notices the ruins, the silence.

**RANGER DAVIS**  
*(into radio)*  
Yeah, this is Davis. The Hart Holler site. Still nothin' here. Just trees and rocks. Yeah, I'll file the report.

He drives on.

### INT. QUANTUM RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY (2025 - WEEKS LATER)

A team of scientists reviews data from Elena's tablet—recovered, partially functioning.

**SCIENTIST #1**  
The quantum signature from this location is... impossible. States shouldn't persist this long.

**SCIENTIST #2**  
It's like the location itself is a quantum system. Like the land remembers.

**SCIENTIST #1**  
Elena was observing something. Something that didn't want to be observed.

They look at each other.

**SCIENTIST #2**  
Should we send another team?

**SCIENTIST #1**  
*(shaking head)*  
Some places don't want to be found. Some stories don't want to be told.

He powers down the tablet.

On the screen, just before it goes dark: **|100⟩**

The holler glows faintly, far away in the mountains.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
