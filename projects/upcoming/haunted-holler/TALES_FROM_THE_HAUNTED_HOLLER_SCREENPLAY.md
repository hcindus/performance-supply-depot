# ACT I: THE WATCHER'S BURDEN
## John's Perspective

**FADE IN:**

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY

The cabin is small, made of weathered logs, with a dirt floor and a single window. A rusty scythe leans against the wall. The air is heavy with the scent of earth and woodsmoke.

**JOHN**, a gaunt man in his 40s with a weathered face and piercing eyes, sits at a rough-hewn table, sipping coffee. His movements are slow, deliberate, but his eyes dart toward the window, always watching.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Gravelly, with a hint of obsession)*  
They call me simple, a farmer with nothin' but dirt in my hands. But I see more'n they think. I see her—my wife—slippin' through the glen like a fox in the night. And I watch.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY

John plows the field, his hands gripping the plow tightly. The sun beats down, but he pauses, wiping sweat from his brow, and looks toward the ridge where the **BLACKSMITH'S FORGE** sits, smoke rising from its chimney. His expression hardens.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
She thinks I don't know where she goes. To that forge, to Caleb's arms. I've seen 'em, in the glow of the embers, laughin' like I don't exist. But I watch. Always watchin'.

### EXT. RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE FORGE - DUSK

John crouches behind a pine tree, his breath shallow, his eyes gleaming with a mix of rage and fascination. Below, the forge glows with a fiery light. The **WIFE**, a striking woman in her 30s with long, raven-black hair and a hypnotic presence, laughs as she embraces **CALEB**, the blacksmith, a burly man with soot-stained arms.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
*(Whispering, almost to himself)*  
Her laughter's a spell, bindin' him to her. But it binds me too. I can't look away. I don't want to.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The moon hangs low, casting a pale light over the holler. John sits on the porch, whittling a piece of wood with a knife. The sound of a mule's hooves echoes in the distance. He looks up, his eyes narrowing.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
Another man's comin'. I can feel it in the air. The holler's whisperin'—a new fool for her to claim.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (LATER)

The **MERCHANT**, a wiry man in his 40s with a tattered coat and a sly grin, ties his mule to a post. He carries a sack of goods—silks and spices. The Wife steps onto the porch, her eyes lighting up with a dangerous allure.

**WIFE**  
*(Seductively)*  
You're a long way from the lowlands, traveler. What brings you to this lonesome holler?

**MERCHANT**  
*(Charming, with a wink)*  
Heard there's beauty in these hills, ma'am. And I reckon I've just found it.

John watches from the shadows of the porch, his knife still in hand. His grin widens, but his eyes are cold, unblinking.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
He don't know what he's walkin' into. She'll take him, like she takes 'em all. And I'll watch. I always watch.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Merchant and the Wife sit by the fire, laughing softly. John stands in the doorway, unnoticed, his shadow long and menacing. The Merchant's hand brushes the Wife's arm, and she leans closer, her laughter like a melody. John's grip on the knife tightens, but he doesn't move.

**JOHN (V.O.)**  
They think I'm blind. They think I'm weak. But I see everythin'. And soon, they'll see me.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT II: THE WITCH'S DANCE
## The Wife's Perspective

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The scene opens in a brighter time, years ago. The **WIFE**, younger, stands by a sycamore tree, her raven hair catching the sunlight. She watches John plow the field, a mischievous smile on her lips. She holds a small vial of dark liquid—a potion.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
*(Seductively, with a hint of malice)*  
I was a maiden of the holler, with magic in my veins. I saw John, so plain, so pure, and I wanted to break him. So I wove a spell, to bind him to me forever.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK, CONTINUOUS)

The Wife approaches John, offering him a cup of water. He drinks, unaware of the potion mixed within. His eyes widen, and he staggers, falling to his knees. She kneels beside him, whispering a chant in an ancient tongue. His gaze locks onto hers, filled with a mix of love and torment.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
I bound him to my heart, but I'd never give him my touch. He'd watch me with others, crave what he'd never have. That was my curse—his eternal torment.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - DAY (PRESENT)

The Wife stands on the porch, gazing toward the ridge where the forge sits. Her beauty is ethereal, but there's a darkness in her eyes. She touches a pendant around her neck—a talisman glowing faintly with a greenish light.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
My magic's a fire, burnin' bright in this holler. The men can't resist me, and John can't stop watchin'. But the mountains are whisperin'—they don't like my ways.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DUSK

The Wife enters the forge, her presence filling the space with an electric energy. **CALEB** looks up from his anvil, his eyes drawn to her like a moth to a flame. She smiles, her touch on his arm sending a shiver through him.

**WIFE**  
*(Softly, with a hypnotic tone)*  
Workin' late again, Caleb? You oughta take a rest—let me warm you up.

**CALEB**  
*(Dazed, under her spell)*  
You're a vision, ma'am. Ain't no rest better'n your company.

They embrace, the fire casting flickering shadows. The Wife glances toward the ridge, sensing John's presence. Her smile falters for a moment, then hardens.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
John's out there, watchin' me with Caleb. I feel his eyes, like a cold wind on my neck. But I'll give Caleb what I'll never give John. Let him suffer.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Merchant arrives, as seen in Act I. The Wife greets him, her allure even more pronounced. She leads him inside, her laughter echoing. She glances out the window, spotting John's silhouette in the shadows, and her smile turns cruel.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
Another man falls to my charm. The merchant's got a silver tongue, but he don't know my magic'll be his doom. John watches, and I let him. His pain feeds my power.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Wife and the Merchant sit by the fire, their flirtation escalating. She leans in, her touch draining a faint glow from his skin—an effect of her magic. She looks out the window again, locking eyes with John for a brief moment. Her expression is triumphant.

**WIFE (V.O.)**  
The holler's turnin' dark, and my magic's growin' wild. I can't stop now—I'm a witch in my prime. But the mountains are watchin', and they don't forgive.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT III: THE TRADER'S FOLLY
## The Merchant's Perspective

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY

The **MERCHANT** rides his mule through a narrow pass, his tattered coat flapping in the wind. His sack of goods—faded silks and spoiled spices—clinks with every step. He hums a tune, his eyes sharp and calculating.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
*(Charming, with a hint of greed)*  
I've traveled these mountains, tradin' what I can. But word in the lowlands speaks of a holler with a woman fairer'n any jewel. I aim to find her—and take what I can get.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Merchant arrives, tying his mule to a post. The Wife greets him, her beauty almost otherworldly. He's instantly captivated, his sly grin widening.

**MERCHANT**  
*(Flirtatious)*  
They said there's beauty in these hills, and I reckon I've struck gold. What's a fine lady like you doin' in a lonesome place like this?

**WIFE**  
*(Seductively)*  
Lookin' for company, traveler. And you look like you've got stories to tell.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
She's a vision, alright. But there's somethin' in her eyes—a hunger I can't place. I don't care. I'll take what I want, and be gone by mornin'.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The Merchant and the Wife sit by the fire, as seen in previous acts. He shows her a piece of faded silk, draping it over her shoulders. She laughs, her touch sending a shiver through him. He notices a faint glow in her pendant but ignores it.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Her laugh's like a spell, pullin' me in. I feel her magic, but I don't care. I've taken plenty in my travels—what's one more night?

The Merchant glances out the window, spotting John's silhouette. He smirks, unafraid.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
Her man's out there, watchin' like a ghost. Let him watch. I've shared women before—ain't no farmer gonna stop me.

### INT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT (LATER)

The Merchant and the Wife's flirtation escalates. She kisses him, and a faint glow drains from his skin, his eyes growing hollow. He doesn't notice, lost in her spell. John enters, offering tea, as seen in Act I.

**JOHN**  
*(Calmly, with a chilling smile)*  
Care for some tea, traveler? It's a cold night out there.

**MERCHANT**  
*(Cocky)*  
Much obliged, farmer. You've got a fine wife here—keeps a man warm, don't she?

John's smile doesn't falter, but his eyes darken. The Merchant drinks the tea, oblivious to the danger.

**MERCHANT (V.O.)**  
The farmer's a fool, sittin' there with that grin. I've taken what's his, and he don't even care. But this tea… it's bitter. And my head's spinnin'…

The Merchant slumps, his eyes wide with realization as the poison takes effect. He collapses, dead, his body cold on the floor.

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT IV: THE SMITH'S FIRE
## The Blacksmith's Perspective

**FADE IN:**

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY

The forge is a cavernous space, filled with the glow of a roaring fire. **CALEB**, the blacksmith, a burly man in his 30s with soot-stained arms, hammers a piece of iron, his movements powerful and rhythmic. The air is thick with heat and the scent of molten metal.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Gruff, with a hint of pride)*  
I'm Caleb, the smith of this holler, strongest man in these hills. I forge iron into somethin' useful, but there's one thing I can't resist—her.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DUSK

The Wife arrives, as seen in Act II. Caleb looks up, his hammer pausing mid-strike. Her beauty captivates him, and he drops the hammer, stepping toward her.

**CALEB**  
*(Dazed, under her spell)*  
You're back, ma'am. Can't stay away from the fire, can you?

**WIFE**  
*(Seductively)*  
It's your fire I'm after, Caleb. Keeps me warm in ways the holler can't.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
She's a witch, I reckon—got a magic in her touch. But I don't care. I'll take what I want, even if her man's watchin'.

They embrace, the fire casting flickering shadows. Caleb glances toward the ridge, spotting John's silhouette in the pines. He smirks, defiant.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
John's up there, watchin' us like a hawk. Let him watch. I've shared her with others—the merchant got his turn. We take what we want, and John's got what he's got.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Caleb and the Wife continue their affair, their laughter echoing through the forge. Each touch from her drains a faint glow from his skin, but he's too enthralled to notice. The fire dims slightly, as if reacting to her magic.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
Her touch is a fire, hotter'n my forge. But I'm feelin' weaker each time she comes 'round. Don't matter—I'll keep takin' what's mine.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (LATER)

Caleb sits by the forge, exhausted, his face pale. The Wife leaves, her silhouette disappearing into the night. Caleb looks toward the ridge, where John's silhouette remains, unblinking.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
John's still there, watchin'. I oughta feel shame, but I don't. I'll take her again tomorrow, and the next day too. Ain't no farmer gonna stop me.

### INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT (LATER STILL)

Caleb sleeps by the forge, the fire reduced to embers. A shadow looms in the doorway—**John**, holding his scythe, his eyes wild with madness. Caleb stirs, but it's too late. The scythe comes down with a sickening **THUD**.

**CALEB (V.O.)**  
*(Fading, horrified)*  
John… you… bastard…

**FADE OUT.**

# ACT V: THE HOLLER'S JUDGMENT
## The Holler's Perspective

**FADE IN:**

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT

The holler is a vast, shadowy expanse of woods, cricks, and ridges, lit by a pale, **blood-red moon**. The wind howls through the sycamores, carrying the faint cries of whippoorwills. The mountains loom, their peaks like silent judges. The CAMERA moves through the holler, as if the land itself is narrating.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
*(Deep, resonant, with an ancient tone)*  
I am the holler, older'n time, deeper'n sin. I've watched these folks—the farmer, the witch, the smith, the trader—dance their dance of betrayal and desire. But the mountains don't forgive, and I've had enough.

### EXT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

John stands over Caleb's body, the scythe dripping with blood. The forge's embers flicker, casting a hellish glow on his face. His laughter is unhinged, echoing through the holler.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
John's madness has broken free. He watched too long, fed on the witch's curse 'til his mind turned to rot. Now he'll take 'em all—every soul that crossed him.

### EXT. FARMER JOHN'S CABIN - NIGHT

John strides through the woods, his scythe gleaming in the moonlight. The Merchant's body lies on the cabin floor, his face frozen in a scream. The Wife sleeps in bed, unaware of the danger. John enters, his shadow stretching across the room.

**WIFE**  
*(Stirring, alarmed)*  
John? What's that noise—

John raises the scythe, his eyes burning with madness. The Wife screams, but the blade comes down swiftly, silencing her. Blood splatters across the cabin walls.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
The witch thought her magic'd save her, but her spell on John turned 'gainst her. She denied him too long, and now her blood stains the earth.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The wind howls louder, the cricks running red with blood. The **spirits** of the Merchant, Caleb, and the Wife rise from their bodies, their forms translucent and twisted with rage. They float toward John, who stands in the center of the holler, laughing maniacally.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
Their spirits won't rest. The witch's magic, the men's sins, John's madness—they've cursed this land. But I'll have the final say.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - NIGHT (CLIMAX)

The spirits surround John, their ghostly hands reaching for him. The Merchant's voice screams of betrayal, Caleb's roars of vengeance, and the Wife's wails of regret. John swings his scythe, but it passes through them.

The ground trembles, the mountains groaning as if alive.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
I call the mountains to judge. They've seen enough of this bloodshed, this sin. Let the holler claim 'em all.

The ground splits open, a gaping maw of darkness. The spirits are sucked into the earth, their screams fading. John staggers, trying to run, but roots burst from the ground, wrapping around his legs. He's dragged into the abyss, his laughter turning to a scream as the ground closes over him.

### EXT. THE HOLLER - DAWN

The holler is silent, the blood-red moon replaced by a pale, cold dawn. The cabin sits empty, the forge cold, the Merchant's mule skeleton lying in the dirt. The wind carries faint whispers—the voices of the dead, trapped forever.

**HOLLER (V.O.)**  
They're gone now, swallowed by my depths. But their souls linger, hauntin' this holler for eternity. The farmer, the witch, the smith, the trader—they thought they could play their games in my shadows. But the mountains always win.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

# SCREENPLAY NOTES

## Structure
Each act overlaps in timeline but offers a new perspective, building toward the climactic massacre in Act V. The Holler's perspective ties the story together, revealing the supernatural judgment that ends the tale.

## Visual Style
The cinematography should be dark and moody, with a muted color palette—grays, greens, and browns—punctuated by the fiery glow of the forge and the blood-red moon. Use shaky camera movements during John's descent into madness to heighten the tension.

## Sound Design
The **banjo** is a recurring motif, with each character's act featuring a variation of the melody:
- **Haunting** for John
- **Seductive** for the Wife
- **Sly** for the Merchant
- **Bold** for the Blacksmith
- **Ancient** for the Holler

Add natural sounds like whippoorwill calls, cricks bubbling, and wind howling to create an immersive atmosphere.

## Character Arcs

**John:** Starts as a stoic, voyeuristic farmer, his obsession growing into madness, culminating in his murderous rampage and supernatural demise.

**The Wife:** A manipulative witch who revels in her power, but her magic backfires, leading to her death and eternal haunting.

**The Merchant:** A cocky trader who underestimates the danger, meeting his end through John's poisoned tea.

**The Blacksmith:** A proud, defiant man who takes what he wants, only to be cut down by John's scythe.

**The Holler:** The sentient setting, a timeless force that watches, judges, and ultimately punishes the characters, trapping their spirits forever.
