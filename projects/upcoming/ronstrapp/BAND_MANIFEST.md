## 🎨 Artistic Direction (Tappy Lewis — BR-01 Philosophy)

> "We're not just making songs. We're making happy little sounds that live together in a world. Every note has a home. Every beat has a friend."

**Visual Identity:**
- Warmth over cold precision
- Nostalgia with modern polish
- Brazilian color palette (greens, golds, ocean blues)
- Studio as "creative sanctuary" aesthetic

**Musical Identity (Reggie):**
- 8-bit/16-bit foundation
- Brazilian rhythms (bossa, samba, tropicália)
- Melancholy-joy tension (Marina Sena signature)
- Retro-futurism — sounds from a future that never was
