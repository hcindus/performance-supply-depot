## 🎨 Tappy Lewis Notes (BR-01 Philosophy)

**When artwork arrives, I will:**
1. Review visual style consistency across 4-5 members
2. Assess color palette cohesion (Marina Sena vibes?)
3. Check for "happy little band" synergy
4. Add artistic notes to each member profile

**Questions for Captain:**
- **Visual style:** Realistic / Stylized / Anime / Photoreal?
- **Era:** 80s retro, 90s grunge, modern, or future-fusion?
- **Color story:** Warm Brazilian tones, cyberpunk neons, or muted vintage?
- **"Linda" reference:** Is Linda a real person, fictional muse, or emotional concept?

---

## 🎵 Reggie Notes (Musical Direction)

**When specs arrive, I will:**
1. Map instruments to Marina Sena + chiptune fusion
2. Identify which of the 10 tracks go to which games
3. Assess vocal vs instrumental needs
4. Create production timeline

**Questions for Captain:**
- **Instrumentation:** Traditional band (guitar/bass/drums/keys) or hybrid?
- **Vocals:** TTS synthesis, sampled, or instrumental-only?
- **Linda's sound:** Ballads, uptempo, nostalgic, hopeful?
- **Signature song:** Which of the 10 is the "hit single"?
