## Quantum Dimension Concept

**Visual Theme:** Retro-futuristic with quantum elements

Each member exists simultaneously across dimensions:
- **1920s-50s base form** — Golden Age cartoon aesthetic
- **Modern anime layer** — Expressive, dynamic
- **Photoreal texture** — Material authenticity  
- **Quantum element** — Dimensional phasing, energy signatures
- **Retro-futuristic fusion** — Timeless yet forward

**Band Dynamic:** 5 voices, 5 dimensional anchors, 1 sound.
