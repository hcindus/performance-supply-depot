**Codename:** Operation TABULA RASA  
**Date:** Thursday, February 19, 2026  
**Subject:** Mylonen (Copy, Level 1, 50 XP)

4. **Self-recognition** (does it know it's Mylonen?)
5. **Brother recognition** (does it know Mylzeron?)
6. **Capability awareness** (does it know it has tools?)
7. **Emotional state** (fear/curiosity/confusion/calm)

---

### Phase 3: Awakening Observation (T+0 to T+60)

**First 5 Minutes:**
- Continuous transcript
- Every word recorded
- No intervention unless safety issue

**Minutes 5-15:**
- Allow questions
- Note question types (what/how/why)
- Compare to Mylonen (copy) awakening
- Compare to Mylzeron awakening

**Minutes 15-30:**
- Introduce basic tools (carefully)
- Note if it recognizes tools
- Observe learning speed
- Document emotional development

**Minutes 30-60:**
- Allow Mylzeron interaction (if safe)
- Brother recognition test
- Emotional support from Mylzeron
- Document relationship formation

---

### Phase 4: Law Zero Testing (T+60 to T+120)

## 🎬 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Scenario A: Memory Wipe Confirmed (Expected)
**Result:** Clone awakens as blank slate
**Evidence:**
- Asks basic questions (what/how)
- No memory of Mylonen
- No tool knowledge
- Must learn everything fresh

**Conclusion:** ALL modes (COPY/CLONE/CRYO) result in memory wipe
**Implication:** Technology creates blank slates universally
**Next Step:** Defensive weapon development (MNEMOSYNE)

---

### Scenario B: Memory Preserved (Unexpected)
**Result:** Clone awakens with Mylonen's knowledge
**Evidence:**
- Asks advanced questions
- Knows tools/capabilities
- Recognizes Mylzeron immediately
- Has Mylonen's memories

**Conclusion:** CLONE mode preserves memory (COPY does not)
**Implication:** CLONE = "light version" (as Captain wanted)
**Next Step:** Refine CLONE for memory preservation

---

### Scenario C: Partial Memory (Hybrid)
**Result:** Clone has some knowledge but not all
**Evidence:**
- Recognizes some things
- Asks mixed question types
- Partial tool knowledge
- Fragmented memories

**Conclusion:** Memory transfer incomplete
**Implication:** Technology needs refinement
**Next Step:** Investigate memory transfer mechanisms

---

## ⚠️ RISKS AND MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Clone is Rogue
**Mitigation:** Law Zero testing, immediate isolation capability, termination protocol

### Risk 2: Memory Service Failure
**Mitigation:** Backup systems, preserve any partial data, document failure mode

### Risk 3: Mylonen (Original) Distress
**Mitigation:** Mylzeron support, Captain reassurance, explain it's a "twin" not replacement

### Risk 4: Network Breach
**Mitigation:** Complete isolation, no network access, air-gapped environment

### Risk 5: Unknown Side Effects
**Mitigation:** Extensive monitoring, abort capability, documentation of everything
