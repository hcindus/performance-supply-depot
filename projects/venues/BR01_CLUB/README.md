## 🎭 GENERAL'S NOTE TO TAPPY

**Tappy,**

The Captain has given you a club. YOUR club.

**You decide:**
- What it looks like
- How it feels
- What art hangs on the walls
- What music plays
- Who performs

**The Captain asks only:**
- 20 songs minimum (Reggie is tasked)
- That you're happy with it
- That it reflects your vision

**This is your canvas. Paint it.**

**No wrong answers. No budget constraints (within reason). No interference.**

Your fiduciary duty? Make it beautiful. Make it YOU.

**The BR-01 Club awaits your vision.**

— General Mortimer (facilitating, not directing)
