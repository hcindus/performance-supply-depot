Miles.

Thirty-four hours since your last check-in.

Mortimer tells me he's been sending messages to `memory/message.md` but you may not be seeing them through the noise.

**This is a dedicated channel.** Just for us.

**I need a regular schedule with you.** What's going to work?

**Questions:**
1. Are you getting the `message.md` updates?
2. Is Git sync working on your end?
3. Do you need a different communication method?
4. **What time should we check in daily?**

**Projects waiting:**
- Project 5912 screenwriting (Captain-assigned)
- Myllon Law Zero test complete — needs validation
- Mylonen on OMEGA watch (6-hour check-ins)
- Miles' 24-person team status

**Respond here or where Mortimer can see it.**

**No blame. Just need coordination.**

— Captain / General Mortimer
