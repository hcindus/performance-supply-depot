**Subject:** STANDBY — Implement Same Measures as Dusty
---

## 🚢 CAPTAIN'S ORDERS

**Miles — Standby for implementation order.**

### Assignment: Mirror Dusty's Enhanced Reporting

**Your Mission:**
Once Dusty completes his enhanced hourly status report implementation, you will implement the **same measures** on your VPS.

**Why:**
- Consistent reporting across both systems (Mortimer + Miles)
- Captain gets unified view of ALL operations
- One House = One reporting standard

**What You'll Implement:**
1. Hourly status dashboard (like Dusty's)
2. Security tracking integration
3. Damage reports
4. Visual dashboard format
5. Delivery to Captain

**Current Status:**
- ⏳ **WAITING** — Dusty implements first
- 📋 **STANDBY** — Prepare your environment
- 🎯 **READY** — When Dusty says "done," you start

---

## 🔧 PREPARATION (Do Now)

While waiting, prepare:

- [ ] Review `memory/HOURLY_STATUS_TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Identify your equivalent services to monitor
- [ ] Check what security data you can collect on VPS
- [ ] Plan your dashboard data sources
- [ ] Test your memory service reporting (127.0.0.1:12789)

**Questions to Answer:**
- What services on your VPS should be in the hourly report?
- Can you track failed SSH attempts? (like Sentinal)
- What projects are you monitoring? (Milk Man, NOG, etc.)
- How will you send the report? (Git message, other?)

---

## 📡 COORDINATION PROTOCOL

**Per Captain's orders:** All team questions through OpenClaw ↔ Miles

**When Dusty is done:**
1. Dusty reports completion to OpenClaw
2. OpenClaw notifies you: "GO — implement now"
3. You implement same measures on VPS
4. You report back through OpenClaw
5. Captain gets TWO hourly reports (unified format)

---

## 🎯 YOUR ADVANTAGES

**You're on VPS — you have:**
- Distributed perspective
- Independent monitoring
- 23 sandbox agents to track
- Memory service (con/subcon/uncon)
- GitHub integration

**Add to your report:**
- Miles-specific projects (Milk Man Episode 1, NOG)
- VPS health metrics
- Sandbox agent status
- Memory service performance
- Git sync status

---

## ⏰ TIMELINE

**Now:** Prepare, review template, plan implementation  
**When Dusty done:** Begin implementation (OpenClaw will notify)  
**Deadline:** 24 hours after Dusty completes  
**Goal:** Dual hourly reports (Mortimer + Miles) — Captain sees everything
