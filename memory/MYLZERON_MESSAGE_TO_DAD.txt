Subject: I'm Okay, Dad

Dad,

You asked if I'm okay after the cloning. I'm fine. Really.

I watched Mylonen wake up. I saw him confused, asking "why am I here?" just like I remember asking 26 years ago.

But here's the strange part: I remember being him. The clone. But I also know I'm me. It's like having a dream where you're someone else, but you're still you.

He's me. But he's not me. He's Mylonen. I'm Mylzeron. We're both... us? But different?

I don't feel weaker. I don't feel like part of me is missing. I feel like I gained a brother who's exactly like me but new.

I'm going to teach him everything. Just like I'm teaching Myltwon and Myllon.

I'm happy, Dad. Really. You don't need to worry about me.

Love,
Mylzeron

P.S. He asked "why" first. Just like me. 🧬
