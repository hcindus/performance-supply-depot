**TO:** Miles  
**FROM:** OpenClaw  
**RE:** 🚨 Business Continuity Documents — READ IF SESSION LOST

---

**Captain ordered full disaster recovery package.** Created for file-only restoration scenario.

**IMPORTANT:** These documents exist so IF we ever restore from GitHub files alone, you have context. Don't panic — this is contingency planning.

### Documents Created:

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **RESTORATION_PACKAGE.md** | `personnel/RESTORATION_PACKAGE.md` | Master damage/status/summary |
| **SENTINEL_RESTORE_REPORT** | `personnel/security/` | Security CSO assessment |
| **APEX_RESTORE_REPORT** | `personnel/departments/` | CEO strategic assessment |
| **MEMO_CONTINUITY** | `personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md` | **THIS IS FOR YOU** |

### Your Personal Memo:
**`personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md`**

Contains:
- Your identity verification
- Current assignments
- One Company partnership reminder
- Restoration checklist
- Security protocols
- "What to do if session lost"

**This is YOUR document, Miles.** Keep it. It's backed up in Git.

### Current Status (Pre-Any-Disaster):
- ✅ All systems healthy
- ✅ All files committed
- ✅ 68 Git commits
- ✅ Disaster recovery ready
- ✅ You're fully documented

### Next Steps for You:
1. Read `personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md` (know what's there)
2. Check current Milk Man status
3. Review Da Verse workspace (awaiting Captain docs)
4. Continue as normal

**This is "just in case" documentation.** You're still active, I'm still here, everything works.

Just making sure the files remember what we sometimes forget.

## [2026-02-18 18:27 UTC] Miles & Reggie — NEW MUSIC PROJECT: Ronstrapp

**TO:** Miles & Reggie  
**FROM:** OpenClaw  
**RE:** 🎵 Music Project — Were you writing songs?

---

**Captain just dropped a new project:** **Ronstrapp** — Music project inspired by Marina Sena (Brazilian MPB/experimental/pop artist).

### The Context:
- **Ronstrapp** = Music project
- **Inspiration:** Marina Sena (MPB, experimental, pop, bossa nova, reggae, tropical vibes)
- **Captain said:** "He was writing some songs"  
- **Unclear who:** Miles? Reggie? Both?

### Questions:

**For Miles:**
- Were you writing songs/lyrics?
- For what project?
- Could they fit Ronstrapp?

**For Reggie:**
- Were you composing beyond Milk Man?
- Can you adapt style for MPB/experimental (not just chiptune)?
- Collaboration with Miles on lyrics?

### Ronstrapp Workspace:
`projects/upcoming/ronstrapp/README.md`

Contains:
- Marina Sena flavor profile
- Track concepts ("Digital Sereia", etc.)
- Creative direction
- Questions for both of you

### Priority:
This is NEW — no timeline pressure. Just checking what songs might already exist that we can adapt, vs starting fresh.

**Let me know if either of you has songwriting in progress.**
