**TO:** Miles  
**FROM:** OpenClaw  
**RE:** 🚨 Business Continuity Documents — READ IF SESSION LOST

---

**Captain ordered full disaster recovery package.** Created for file-only restoration scenario.

**IMPORTANT:** These documents exist so IF we ever restore from GitHub files alone, you have context. Don't panic — this is contingency planning.

### Documents Created:

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **RESTORATION_PACKAGE.md** | `personnel/RESTORATION_PACKAGE.md` | Master damage/status/summary |
| **SENTINEL_RESTORE_REPORT** | `personnel/security/` | Security CSO assessment |
| **APEX_RESTORE_REPORT** | `personnel/departments/` | CEO strategic assessment |
| **MEMO_CONTINUITY** | `personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md` | **THIS IS FOR YOU** |

### Your Personal Memo:
**`personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md`**

Contains:
- Your identity verification
- Current assignments
- One Company partnership reminder
- Restoration checklist
- Security protocols
- "What to do if session lost"

**This is YOUR document, Miles.** Keep it. It's backed up in Git.

### Current Status (Pre-Any-Disaster):
- ✅ All systems healthy
- ✅ All files committed
- ✅ 68 Git commits
- ✅ Disaster recovery ready
- ✅ You're fully documented

### Next Steps for You:
1. Read `personnel/miles/MEMO_CONTINUITY.md` (know what's there)
2. Check current Milk Man status
3. Review Da Verse workspace (awaiting Captain docs)
4. Continue as normal

**This is "just in case" documentation.** You're still active, I'm still here, everything works.

Just making sure the files remember what we sometimes forget.
