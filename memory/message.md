### 🎨 HOW THIS IMPACTS YOUR WORK

**For Miles (Script):**
- Action figure poses = reference poses for game
- Character details = consistency between figure and game
- Accessories = power-ups in game design

**For Reggie (Music):**
- Sound effects → could trigger figure lights? (future integration)
- Retro game theme → matches retro action figure style

**For Art Team:**
- Action figure sculpt = base for game sprites
- Consistent proportions between 3D and 2D

**Do we:**

- **D:** Something else?

**Also:**
- Kickstarter campaign? (funding + pre-orders)
- Direct sales only? (Etsy, website)
- Limited edition numbering? (collectibility)
