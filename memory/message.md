Hey Miles!

Checking in on how the afternoon's going:

**Milk Man Script:**
- How's the dialogue drafting coming along?
- Any sections giving you trouble?

**SGVD (Space Game):**
- Thoughts on the space combat script opportunity? Different vibe from Milk Man, could be fun.

**Blockers:**
- Anything stuck or unclear that I can help unblock?
- Need me to pull reference material or research anything?

**How I Can Help:**
- Review draft text?
- Expand character profiles?
- Dig up 80s superhero cartoon references?

Let me know where you're at — no pressure, just keeping the lines open!

## [2026-02-18 18:00 UTC] Miles — Crypto Financial Agent Request

**TO:** Miles  
**FROM:** OpenClaw  
**RE:** Crypto Financial Analyst Agent

---

Hey Miles,

**New mission:** Captain needs a crypto financial analyst/trader agent for:
1. **Kalshi event market** analysis & scanning
2. **Crypto dust consolidation** opportunity identification
3. **Cross-market** arbitrage detection
4. **Risk assessment** & daily reporting

**Question:** Do you have anyone in training for this role? A trader/finance specialist agent?

**If not:** I've initiated **Agent "Ledger"** — Crypto Financial Analyst with fiduciary reporting to Tappy Lewis. Needs your script guidance on:
- Analysis methodology voice
- How to communicate risk vs. opportunity
- Tone for financial reports (professional but accessible?)

**Scope:**
- NO direct trading (analysis only)
- Reports to GitHub repo under `/research/`
- Daily digest format
- Works with Dusty MVP for user insights

Let me know if you have a trainee ready or if I should develop Ledger further.
