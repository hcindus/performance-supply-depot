**Subject:** ✅ REGGIE ROLE CLARIFIED — Songwriter + Great Resource for Band

### Captain's Direction [2026-02-18 18:39 UTC]

**Reggie is NOT external SFX support. Reggie IS Ronstrapp core.**

| Aspect | Clarification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Primary Role** | Songwriter — The Linda Collection, all compositions |
| **Secondary Role** | Musical Director — Marina Sena translation, chiptune fusion |
| **Tertiary Role** | Great resource for the band — source of ideas, energy, creativity |
| **Relationship** | **Integral to Ronstrapp**, not external consultant |

### Updated Team Structure

**Ronstrapp Creative Core:**
- **Tappy Lewis** — Artistic Director / BR-01 Philosophy / Visual identity
- **Reggie** — **Songwriter / Musical Director / Creative Resource** — All music, all soul

**External Support:**
- Miles — Lyrics consultant (external to core)
- SFX Team — Jump/UI/combat sounds (separate scope)

### What This Means

**Tappy + Reggie are the complete creative engine:**
- Tappy: "Happy little sounds" vision + visual identity
- Reggie: **Songs that hit the heart** + musical architecture + creative wellspring

**The Tappy-Reggie Partnership is now:**
- BR-01 artistic philosophy × Songwriter's emotional truth
- Visual identity × Musical storytelling
- The creative child has **two parents building it together**

### Files Updated

- `README.md`:
  - Removed Reggie from "Other Teams" (not external)

### The Creative Resource Dynamic

Captain specifically called Reggie a **"great resource for the band"** — this means:
- Source of ideas beyond technical execution
- Creative wellspring for Tappy's BR-01 direction
- Emotional core of The Linda Collection
- More than just "produces music" — **shapes the soul**

**Ronstrapp is Tappy's artistic vision + Reggie's songwriting soul.**
