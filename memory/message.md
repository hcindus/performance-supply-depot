**RE:** Milk Man - Canon Worldbuilding Ready!

---

### 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH!

**Captain just delivered OFFICIAL GAME LORE!**

This is canon worldbuilding for the Milk Man universe — everything you need to script from:

**Location:** `projects/milkman-game/script/MARKET_LORE.md`

**What you got:**
- ✅ Full battle narrative (Grand Dairyopolis Market)
- ✅ Detailed Shoezet character (Level 3 boss)
- ✅ Detailed Vil Laine (Level 2 boss, CONFLICTED — he has crush on Shoezet!)
- ✅ The Cream Crown twist (Level 2 fake, Level 3 real)
- ✅ 6 full cinematic scenes (opening → ending)
- ✅ Level breakdown with enemy types
- ✅ Game mechanic ideas
- ✅ Comedy puns and dialogue examples
- ✅ Visual/audio references

**Major plot points:**
1. **Level 1:** Market chaos, Boy Scouts, citizens to rescue
2. **Level 2:** Vil's Lair — boss FIGHTS but HESITATES (crush on Shoezet)
3. **Twist:** Crown is FAKE at end of Level 2!
4. **Level 3:** Shoe-Fortress + real Crown + both villains?
5. **Vil might DEFECT to shoezet side (or help Milk Man)**

### 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS

**Priority 1:** Script the cinematic scenes (in MARKET_LORE.md)

1. **Scene 1: Opening** — Market erupts, Shoezet on cheese cart
2. **Scene 2: Level 2 Entry** — Vil's monologue, crush revealed
3. **Scene 3: Level 2 End** — Fake Crown reveal, Shoezet cackle
4. **Scene 4: Level 3 Entry** — The March (citizens + Milk Man)
5. **Scene 5: Level 3 Boss** — Final confrontation
6. **Scene 6: Ending** — Crown destroyed, victory

**Priority 2:** Boss dialogue (comedy lines)
- Vil's puns about acidity/milk fat percentages
- Shoezet's dairy puns ("My cream is DAIRY good!")
- Milk Man quips ("Got justice!", "I'm lactose intolerant... to your EVIL!")

**Priority 3:** Level design notes
- Enemy placement
- Wave patterns
- Boss attack patterns (from lore)

### 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR SCRIPTING

**Vil Laine is COMPLICATED:**
- Evil villain on surface
- Secret heart-eyes for Shoezet
- Cannot strike her directly
- Will he betray his Legion? Join her? Help Milk Man?
**This is GOLD for level 2-3 narrative!**

**Shoezet is GLAMOROUS EVIL:**
- Gaudy shawl, flamboyant wig
- Addictive cream empire
- Commands children (Shoezet Syndicate)
- Cackles at reveal
- "My dairy empire!" (defeat line)

**Milk Man is PURE HERO:**
- Cleansing mist frees citizens
- Churn-staff weapon
- Rally speeches
- Dairy puns
- Beacon of hope
