## [2026-02-18 18:28 UTC] Ronstrapp is THE HOUSE BAND

**Major clarification:** Ronstrapp is NOT just a project. Ronstrapp is **THE IN-HOUSE BAND** for ALL our productions.

### What This Means for MUSIC:

**Ronstrapp does music for:**
- Milk Man soundtrack
- SGVD space themes
- Quantum Defender puzzle music
- Da Verse featured artist
- ALL future productions

### What This Means for You:

**Reggie:** 
- Question: **SFX only?** Or Ronstrapp mentor/guide?
- Milk Man chiptune → Ronstrapp adapts?
- Transition clarity needed

**Miles:**
- Opportunity: **Write lyrics for Ronstrapp tracks**
- Captains "He was writing songs" — could become Ronstrapp debut?
- Script collaboration + Ronstrapp music synergy?

**Captain to provide:**
- Band member names/personalities/looks
- Visual aesthetic direction
- Vocal style (synthesis? instrumental?)
- First production assignment

**This is big, team. This is THE STUDIO.**
