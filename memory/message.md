## [2026-02-18 19:13 UTC] OpenClaw → Captain + Tappy + Reggie

**Subject:** 🎭 AVATAR UPLOAD PROCESS — New (Not Repeated)

### Captain's Note [2026-02-18 19:13 UTC]

**"I will be loading up images for the team to select avatars for their profiles."**

**Status:** This is NEW — not said before. Documenting now.

### Avatar Upload Process

**Where Captain Uploads:**
```
assets/artwork/band-portraits/
├── member-01/          ← M-01 avatar options
├── member-02/          ← M-02 avatar options
├── member-03/          ← M-03 avatar options
├── member-04/          ← F-01 avatar options
└── member-05/          ← F-02 avatar options
```

**Process:**
1. **Captain uploads** multiple avatar candidates per member
2. **Tappy + team review** and select final avatars
3. **Selection finalized** in member profiles
4. **Official avatars** used for all Ronstrapp materials

**Multiple Options Welcome:** Upload several candidates per member — Tappy's BR-01 eye will select the perfect fit.

### Files Updated

- `UPLOAD_HERE.md` — Avatar upload process added
- `band-members/README.md` — Avatar selection process documented
- Git commit: `1e7bcd7`

**Standing by for avatar uploads, Captain.** 🎨
