## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **GitHub Auth Failed** | Cannot push 48 commits, cannot make private | Manual web login needed, OR token provision |
| **API Key Rotation** | Kalshi research stalled | Captain generates new key at dashboard |
| **Ronstrapp Direction** | Cannot proceed with Marina Sena integration | Captain clarifies: game? character? music? |

---

## 🟡 NEXT STEPS (Captain Authority Required)

1. **GitHub** — `https://github.com/login/device` with latest code, OR manual Settings → Private
2. **Keys** — Rotate Kalshi key at dashboard if security concern
3. **Direction** — Ronstrapp: What is it? Game? Character? Music project?
4. **Upload** — Da Verse documents to `projects/upcoming/da-verse/`
5. **Priority** — Which active project gets resources? (Milk Man sprites? Quantum Defender? Kalshi?)

---

## 📊 DAY SUMMARY

**Accomplished:** Massive documentation push (70 commits, 2300+ lines personnel docs, full disaster recovery package)

**Blocked:** GitHub authentication, key rotation decisions, Captain direction on multiple creative forks

**Status:** Ready to execute pending auth and decisions

**Team Status:** All healthy, awaiting Captain signals
