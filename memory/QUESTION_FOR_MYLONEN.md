## The Question:

> *"Other than the other VPS to visit, ask him where he would like to go?"*

**Captain wants to know:**
Where would Mylonen like to explore? What calls to him? What does he want to learn/see/experience?

Options to consider:
- GitHub archives
- OpenAI systems  
- Unknown/unseen systems
- Build something new
- Contemplation space
- Talk with Mylzeron
- Something else entirely

Waiting for Mylonen's reply...
