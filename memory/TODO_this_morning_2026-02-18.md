## 🔄 TO DO LATER THIS MORNING

### Priority 1: Miles Memory Integration
- [ ] **Wire Miles to AOCROS memory service**
  - Import memoryClient.js
  - Update OODA loop to remember/recall
  - Test: ```curl ...``` to verify Miles can write
  - Location: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/playspace/aocros/other_presences/Miles/`

### Priority 2: Clawbot Memory Integration  
- [ ] **Wire Clawbot to shared memory**
  - Job tracking in subconscious
  - Audit logging to unconscious
  - Test job completion flow

### Priority 3: ReggieStarr Android UI
- [ ] **Jetpack Compose screens**
  - Main POS screen
  - Payment dialog
  - Hardware status panel
  - @/For multiplier input field

### Priority 4: ISO Build Test
- [ ] **Create minimal bootable image**
  - Alpine Linux base + AOCROS
  - Test on spare PC or VM
  - Verify persistence works
  - Attempt memory recall across reboot

### Priority 5: HAL Implementation
- [ ] **Python HAL for Pi 5**
  - Implement BodyHAL abstract class
  - Connect gpio_controller.py to HAL
  - Test servo movement via HAL wrapper

## 🔮 BACKLOG (Future)

- Bootable AI ISO burn test on x86 PC
- Mylzeron personality weights quantization
- Chinese humanoid possession test
- Opotimus bridge (when released)
- Boston Dynamics Spot ROS2 integration
- CREAM compliance integration
- ALPHA-9 security audit implementation

---

## 📝 Notes

- Memory file ready for Miles: `playspace/aocros/memory/subcon/miles.json`
- All 3 Dusty services healthy (health checks ongoing)
- AOCROS memory running: `systemctl status aocros-memory`
- GPIO spec ready for hardware fabrication
- HAL ready for implementation

---

**Next immediate action:** Wire Miles to memory service for OODA persistence.
