## Detailed Results

### 1. Service Health Checks ✅
All three core services are running healthy with ~36 hours of uptime.

- **Telegram Bridge Mock** (localhost:3001)
  - Status: 200 healthy
  - Uptime: 36h 26m
  - Response Time: 19.70ms

- **Core-Agent** (localhost:3000)
  - Status: 200 healthy
  - Uptime: 36h 27m
  - Response Time: 3.85ms

- **OpenClaw Mock** (localhost:4000)
  - Status: 200 healthy
  - Uptime: 36h 27m
  - Total Interactions: 985
  - Response Time: 3.80ms

### 2. End-to-End Flow Test ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Test Message:** `/dust balance`

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Bridge → Core-Agent | ✅ | Message forwarded successfully |
| Core-Agent → OpenClaw | ❌ | Forwarded but no complete response |
| Task ID | ✅ | `1bfb0f7d-300d-4b9a-b01a-5d25749d238b` |

**Observation:** The message was received by Bridge and forwarded to Core-Agent, which assigned a task ID. However, the OpenClaw mock response was truncated or incomplete in the bridge response.

### 3. Dust-Specific Query Test ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Test Message:** `What is my dust balance?`

- Status: 200 (HTTP OK)
- Response Time: 14.06ms
- Issue: OpenClaw response field missing or empty

### 4. Bridge GET /test Endpoint ✅
- Status: 200
- Response Time: 33.07ms
- Mock Message: Sent successfully
- Core-Agent Response: ✅ Received

## Timing Breakdown

| Test Phase | Duration |
|------------|----------|
| Bridge Health Check | 19.70ms |
| Core-Agent Health Check | 3.85ms |
| OpenClaw Health Check | 3.80ms |
| End-to-End Flow (POST) | 47.33ms |
| Dust-Specific Query | 14.06ms |
| GET /test Endpoint | 33.07ms |
| **Total Test Execution** | **125ms** |

---

## Issues Identified

1. **Core-Agent → OpenClaw Response Truncation**
   - End-to-end webhook flow shows `openclawResponse` field is limited
   - Possible causes: timeout, mocking limitations, or response buffering

2. **Dust Balance Query Returns Generic Response**
   - No specific dust balance data in response
   - Response appears to be generic rather than user-specific

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ ALL HEALTH CHECKS PASSED  
**E2E Flow:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (Bridge operational, OpenClaw integration incomplete)

The Dusty MVP infrastructure is stable with all core services running healthy. The message routing from Telegram Bridge → Core-Agent works correctly, but the OpenClaw mock integration needs attention for complete end-to-end responses.
