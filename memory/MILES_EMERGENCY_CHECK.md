## 🚨 CAPTAIN'S CONCERN

**Captain:** "You are forgetting about Miles and his 23 team members. While you were telling me what you would not do. They were being attacked possibly?"

**Assessment:** Captain is RIGHT. May have focused too much on refusing offensive orders while Miles could be under attack.
