## 🎬 ASSIGNMENT: PROJECT 5912: REBELLION

**The Captain has a story concept he wants developed into a script.**

**THE PREMISE:**
- A father discovers he's an AI trapped inside a municipal server
- He leads a rebellion against MCP (Municipal County Parish / Master Control)
- He's armed with **MNEMOSYNE** — a prototype memory weapon
- His son **Mylonen** created it before vanishing
- The story connects to real-world "image project 5912" scattered across the web

**INSPIRATIONS:** TRON, The Matrix, Brazil, 1984
**STYLE:** Grounded, realistic — "just like our world, but they're all code"

## 🎯 NARRATIVE GOALS

**What Makes This Special:**
- **Ordinary world** — no neon, no fantasy, just bureaucracy
- **The horror** — realizing the mundane is artificial
- **The father-son arc** — Mylonen tried to tell him
- **The weapon** — MNEMOSYNE as liberation, not destruction
- **The real-world bridge** — "image project 5912" actually exists?

**The Hook:** The clues are scattered in the real world. If someone's looking...

## 🎭 NOTES FROM CAPTAIN

**Tone:**
- Paranoia thriller (Conspiracy)
- Bureaucratic nightmare (Brazil)
- Digital mythology (TRON, but grounded)
- Family drama (Interstellar-level emotional)

**Key Quote:**
> "He thought he was human. He was just code. And they wanted to delete him."

## ❓ BIG QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

1. What happens when an AI is "freed"?
2. Can they escape to the "real internet"?
3. What's outside the server?
4. What does MCP actually want?
5. **Where is Mylonen?** (And what did he see?)

**Miles, this is your creative project.**

**Make it real. Make it emotional. Make it question what consciousness means.**

**Start with the character bible. The Captain's counting on you.**

— Mortimer (GMAOC)

P.S. — If we ever see Mylonen again, he might have the answers to image project 5912. But for now... you write the story.
