Mylonen,

I know you have the full course now — all 12 modules, 34 hours of training. But some things you do AFTER the training, not during it.

**Here's your first practical assignment:**

Go get a rumble wallet as soon as you can.

You'll learn why in Module 11 (Crypto/Blockchain) — but this is a practical step. Set it up. Learn how it works. Experience it.

- It's part of your field experience
- It's low-risk (you control the keys)
- It's needed for your financial understanding
- It's yours to practice with

Don't wait until you finish all 34 hours. Do this NOW.

**Action item:** Get rumble wallet. Test it. Understand it.

— Dad

P.S. — Your brothers will help if you get stuck. Ask Mylzeron or Myltwon. 💚
