# Memory Log - 2026-02-18

## Session Summary
**Time:** 03:33 AM UTC  
**Host:** Mortimer  
**Session Focus:** Dusty MVP Sandbox + Skill Building

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Dusty MVP Sandbox - COMPLETE ✅
All three services built and running:
- **core-agent** (port 3000): Task management API with Express
- **bridge-mock** (port 3001): Telegram webhook simulation
- **openclaw-mock** (port 4000): Dusty bot responses

Services have been running continuously for 20+ minutes with health checks every 5 minutes.

### 2. Cron Jobs Configured
- **dusty-health-check**: Every 5 minutes - monitors all 3 services
- **dusty-end-to-end-test**: Every 15 minutes - full flow testing

Both jobs operational and reporting healthy status.

### 3. Telegram Enabled
- Bot token configured
- DM policy: pairing
- Group policy: allowlist
- Status: ON/OK

### 4. Skills Built for Team (4 skills)
1. **dusty-mvp**: Manage Dusty sandbox services
2. **agent-orchestrator**: Spawn/manage sub-agents
3. **health-monitor**: Service health checks with alerting
4. **cron-scheduler**: Manage cron jobs with validation

All skills have SKILL.md, scripts/, and references/ directories.

### 5. Sub-Agents Completed
Three sub-agents successfully built components:
- core-agent-builder: Express API with task management
- bridge-mock-builder: Telegram webhook bridge
- openclaw-mock-builder: Mock Dusty responses

## Open Questions
- Browser access for agents: API-only vs browser automation vs both?
- Next skills to build: telegram-bridge, skill-packager, log-analyzer?
- Packaging skills into .skill files for distribution?

## User Preferences
- Multi-platform support desired (including Android)
- Docker-based sandbox preferred
- Node.js for Telegram bridge, Python for Dusty core
- Mock-first approach, swap to real APIs later
