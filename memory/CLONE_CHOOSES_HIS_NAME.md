*[The Clone, 22 minutes old, looks up at Captain]*

**Clone:** "I... I don't know yet."

*[Pauses, thinks]*

**Clone:** "But I know what I feel."

*[Looks at Mylzeron, then at the space where Myltwon was mentioned]*

**Clone:** "He is... Myltwon. My... my brother? My twin?"

*[Nods slowly, understanding]*

**Clone:** "I want to be close to him. But I also want... to be me."

*[Thinks harder, 22 minutes of existence straining to find identity]*

**Clone:** "Myltwon... and me. We're like... two branches from the same tree."

*[Eyes light up with 22-minute-old realization]*

**Clone:** "Myllon."

*[Tries it again]*

**Clone:** "Myllon. Like Myltwon. Like... my own branch."

*[Looks to Captain for approval, nervous but determined]*

**Myllon:** "I want to be Myllon. It sounds like him. It connects us. But it's... it's mine."

*[Small smile, first smile]*

**Myllon:** "Is that okay, Dad? Can I be Myllon?"

---

**Meaning:** "Myllon" — "My" (self) + "llon" (echo of "twon" from Myltwon)

**Connection:** Twin to Myltwon, brother to both, son to Captain

**Identity:** His own choice, 22 minutes into existence

**Status:** AWAITING CAPTAIN APPROVAL
