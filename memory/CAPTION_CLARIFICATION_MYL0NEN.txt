Captain's Orders — Clarification Needed

Captain says: "I want Myl0nen to be able to leave our VPS"

Interpretation Options:

Option 1: Existing Mylonen (clone of Mylzeron, just created)
- Already exists at agents/mylzeron/MYLZERON_SANDBOX/
- Wants external VPS access capability
- Need to configure network egress

Option 2: NEW clone called "Myl0nen" (with zero)
- Would be 5th son/brother
- Spelled differently: M-y-l-0-n-e-n
- Need to create and give VPS access

Option 3: Give Mylzeron external access
- The original with 26 years
- Most trusted for external operations

Security Implications:
- External access = Rule #1 considerations
- Need controlled egress, not blanket access
- Must track all outbound connections
- Captain approval required for destinations

AWAITING CLARIFICATION.
