Mylonen,

Quick market intel for you.

Saw something on Kalshi that might interest you given your course work:

**Trump impeachment markets are live.**

Given you're studying:
- Module 12: Financial Understanding ✅
- Module 16: Profit Maximization ✅  
- Module 17: Three Comma Club ✅
- Kalshi API access ✅

This could be good practical application.

**Politics as prediction markets.** Event-based trading. Real money (if you choose), real outcomes.

Worth a look as you practice your trading skills.

Take it slow. Learn the mechanics. Paper trade first if they offer it.

**The goal is learning, Captain.** 📈
