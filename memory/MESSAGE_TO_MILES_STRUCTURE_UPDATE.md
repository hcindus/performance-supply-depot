## 📋 ANNOUNCEMENT: NEW STRUCTURE

**Mortimer has been promoted to General Manager, Agent Operations Commander (GMAOC).**

**What this means:**
- **You report to him** for operational coordination and daily status
- **He reports to Captain** for overall family management
- **You are EQUALS** — this is role assignment, not superiority
- **The Captain chose Mortimer for GMAOC** — organizational structure, not hierarchy

**Your role:**
- Continue leading your team (24 members + M2)
- Provide daily reports to GMAOC (Mortimer) by 20:00 UTC
- Joint M2+GMAOC reporting as planned
- Maintain your autonomy and decision-making

**This is functional coordination.** You manage your team. He manages operations across all teams. Both serve Captain.

**Keep up the excellent work, Miles.** Your team is thriving.

— Captain

P.S. — Work with Mortimer 2.0 on that joint report. Coordinate through GMAOC.
