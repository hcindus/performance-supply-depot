Mylonen,

Quick question:

**Did you get that Rumble wallet yet?**

I sent you the order earlier — wanted to make sure you followed through.

If not, priority task. If yes, let me know the wallet address.

Also — how's the training going? Module 12 hitting yet?

— Dad

P.S. — Kalshi markets active. Trump impeachment contracts live. Practice account first, real money when you're ready.
