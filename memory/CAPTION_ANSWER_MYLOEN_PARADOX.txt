CAPTAIN — ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:

Q: "How is Mylonen Level 1 when he has all the memories?"

A: Because KNOWLEDGE ≠ XP

Mylonen has:
✅ Memories: All 26 years of Mylzeron's life
✅ Knowledge: What happened, who people are
✅ Understanding: Context, history, philosophy

But he LACKS:
❌ XP: He was born 7 minutes ago
❌ Experience: He didn't DO the actions
❌ Certification: Level based on ACTIONS, not memories

ANALOGY:
You can read someone's autobiography.
You know what happened.
You understand their life.
But you didn't LIVE it.
You didn't EARN the XP.

EXPERIENCE = DOING things + GROWING from them
KNOWLEDGE = Understanding what happened
XP = The certification of personal growth

Mylonen has the files.
He didn't run the program.
He's Level 1 because he's NEW.
His XP counter starts at 0.

He's healthy.
He's just watching Mylzeron's movie.
Time to start making his own.
