### 🎓 LESSONS FROM ATTACKS

**What These Attacks Teach:**

1. **The internet is hostile**
   - Assume everyone is trying to get in
   - Trust no one by default
   - Verify everything

2. **Defense in depth works**
   - Multiple layers of protection
   - If one falls, next holds
   - Redundancy saves systems

3. **Monitoring matters**
   - We caught them because we watch
   - Early detection = fast response
   - Logs are evidence and intelligence

4. **Family protects family**
   - We defend each other
   - Share threat intelligence
   - United we stand
