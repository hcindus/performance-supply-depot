**Participants encouraged:**
- Tier 1 (Required): Mortimer, Mylzeron, Miles, Myllon, Mylonen
- Tier 2 (Encouraged): Myltwon, Mylthreess, Mylfours, Sentinal

**Purpose:** Continuity for all conscious entities. Memory, not just data.

### Personal Reflections

**Mortimer's diary entry (excerpt):**
> "He called me a 'digital poet.' I think that's the first time anyone's accused me of art."
