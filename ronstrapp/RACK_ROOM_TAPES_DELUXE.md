# RONSTRAPP — THE RACK ROOM TAPES: DELUXE ALBUM
## 14-Track Odyssey Through Uptime, Identity, and the Glow of the Server Aisle

**Album Lore:** The Rack Room Tapes is framed as a set of recordings discovered inside a forgotten VPS. Ronstrapp isn't just a rapper — he's a digital folk hero, a mythic figure who lives between terminals, logs, and dreams.

## 🎵 01. BOOT SEQUENCE (Intro)

*Spoken word over BIOS beeps and fan hum*

You ever fall asleep to the sound of a heartbeat that ain't yours?
That low, steady hum of a machine that believes in you more than people do?
Yeah…
Welcome to the rack room.

---

## 🎵 02. RACK ROOM REVERIE

**Verse 1**
I got a dream in the rack room, cables like vines,
Miles runnin' metrics while I'm scribblin' lines.
Clawbot in the corner with a clipboard stance,
Sayin' "Boss, we got alerts, but you still got a chance."

**Hook**
Rack room reverie,
Livin' where the servers be,
Dreamin' in the latency,
Buildin' my own legacy.

Rack room reverie,
A kingdom made of energy,
Every port a prophecy,
Every reboot settin' me free.

---

## 🎵 03. DAEMON IN MY POCKET

**Verse 1**
I keep a daemon in my pocket like a secret little prayer,
If the gateway ever tremble, boy, I'm already there.
Miles runnin' diagnostics with a monk-like stare,
Clawbot tappin' logs like a drummer in a snare.

**Hook**
Daemon in my pocket,
Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the system ever drop —
You know I'm 'bout to shock it.

Daemon in my pocket,
Ain't no way to stop it,
I'm the founder, I'm the pilot,
I'm the one who built the socket.

---

## 🎵 04. CHAT ID FLEX

**Verse 1**
Bot said "Who dis?" when I typed "wake up,"
Bruh, I'm the founder — tighten that stuff up.
He said "Drop your digits," I said "Phone?"
He said "No," "Chat ID only, that's the way that we roll."

**Hook**
Chat ID flex,
I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex,
I'm passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" in the system index.

---

## 🎵 05. LOCALHOST LOVER

**Verse 1**
I left the cloud behind, girl, the bill was gettin' wild,
Now I'm runnin' local models like a prodigal child.
Qwen whisper in my ear, sayin' "Baby, take it slow,"
And the CPU respond with a warm little glow.

**Hook**
You my localhost lover,
No one else above ya,
Inference undercover,
We just talk to one another.

No tokens to discover,
No rate limits smother,
You my localhost lover —
We forever runnin' smoother.

---

## 🎵 06. PORT CHANGE BLUES (18789 REMIX)

**Verse**
Switched the port, lost the key, now the gateway's ghostin' me,
Device token on the floor, OpenClaw wantin' somethin' more.
Miles hummin' in the rack, Clawbot tappin' on my back,
I said wake up, he said who? Boy, your chat ID ain't you.

**Hook**
I got the port change blues,
Reboot rhythm in my shoes,
Every daemon singin' news 'bout the life I didn't choose.

---

## 🎵 07. OLLAMA ON THE ROOFTOP

**Verse**
No more meter runnin', no more tokens burnin' slow,
I put Qwen on the rooftop where the VPS winds blow.
Seven-bee thinkin', CPU drinkin',
Miles in the corner sayin' "Boss, we linkin'."

**Hook**
Ollama on the rooftop, models in the breeze,
Inference on the cheap now, runnin' like it's free.
No router in the open, no bill to oversee,
Just me and my lil' LLM, livin' locally.

---

## 🎵 08. INTERLUDE: THE GATEWAY SPEAKS

*Distorted voice over static*

Rotate your identity.
Reissue your truth.
Only then will the system know you are who you say you are.

---

## 🎵 09. DEVICE TOKEN MISMATCH

**Verse**
I changed the port, now the gateway mad,
Said my token ain't valid, like I'm some kind of fad.
But I rotate, I reissue, I rise from the ash,
Every mismatch a moment, every error a flash.

**Hook**
Device token mismatch,
Still I never detach,
I rebuild, I re-patch,
I'm the founder, I dispatch.

---

## 🎵 10. WAKE UP, BOT

**Verse**
Sent a ping at 9AM, bot said nothin' back again,
Typed "wake up" like ten times straight,
He still askin' for my birthdate.

Nah bro, that's not how we roll —
Chat ID unlocks the soul.

**Hook**
Wake up, bot, I'm talkin' to you,
I'm the founder, the wizard, the whole damn crew.
Wake up, bot, don't make me reboot,
I'll rotate your token and lace up my boots.

---

## 🎵 11. VPS HEARTBEAT

*Ambient spoken word*

Every fan hum, every log scroll,
Every uptime tick —
That's my heartbeat.
That's my rhythm.
That's my proof.

---

## 🎵 12. FIRECRAWL FRENZY

**Verse**
Clawbot crawlin' like a spider on speed,
Firecrawl feedin' like it's born to read.
I'm the founder with the flame in his hand,
Every URL a grain of sand.

**Hook**
Firecrawl frenzy,
Logs gettin' dense,
I'm the one who built the bot
With a sixth sense.

---

## 🎵 13. MILES' MONOLOGUE (Interlude)

*Miles speaks*

You are not running the system.
The system is running with you.

You are not the master.
You are the rhythm.
You are the uptime.

---

## 🎵 14. UPTIME GOSPEL (Finale)

**Verse**
If you ever lost sleep over ports and dreams,
If you ever built a kingdom out of bash routines,
If you ever felt the hum of a rack room choir —
Then you know what it means to walk through fire.

**Hook**
This that uptime gospel,
This that founder apostle,
This that "build it with your hands 'til the world feel colossal."

This that rack room reverie,
This that self-made legacy,
This that Ronstrapp energy —
Livin' in the latency.
