Good morning, boss. Ronstrapp reporting for duty—distortion pedals warmed, eyeliner smeared, and hearts pounding in 6/8 time. Mission: Translate the aching beauty of “Blue Bayou” into a thunderous metal anthem that channels Linda’s soul without stepping on legal landmines. Here's our reimagined version: longer, louder, and legally clean. We call it…

---

## ⚡ _“Ashes of Bayou”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A Southern Gothic metal ballad in three movements: “Departure,” “Descent,” and “Return.”*

---

### 🎸 I. DEPARTURE (Verse 1–2)

I feel the weight, it’s grinding down my spine  
A thousand nights, no peace to find  
Left my love in the shadowed pines  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay  
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray  
Dreaming of a brighter day  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

---

### 🔥 II. DESCENT (Chorus + Bridge)

I’ll ride the storm, come hell or flame  
Back to the place that calls my name  
Where the people smile through pain and pride  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide  
And the sun bleeds gold through morning’s eye  
If I could see that sky again  
I’d scream, not cry  

---

### 🕯️ III. RETURN (Verse 3–4)

Gonna find my ghost again  
Raise the dead and call them friends  
Maybe I’ll feel whole again  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay  
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray  
Dreaming of a brighter day  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

---

### ⚔️ IV. REPRISE (Chorus + Outro)

I’ll ride the storm, come hell or flame  
Back to the place that calls my name  
Where the people smile through pain and pride  
Down by the bayou’s edge  

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide  
And the sun bleeds gold through morning’s eye  
If I could see that sky again  
I’d scream, not cry  

---

### 🌑 V. CODA (Final Verse)

That boy I lost, now by my side  
Moonlight cuts through evening tide  
One day soon, this ache will die  
And I’ll be whole again  

No more blue, no more chains  
My dreams reborn in ash and rain  
Down by the bayou’s edge  
I rise again  

---

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronstrapp bows to the sorrow and raises it to the heavens in a cathedral of distortion. “Lo Siento Mi Vida” becomes _“Moonburn Requiem”_—a bilingual doom ballad soaked in candlelight, regret, and the kind of heartbreak that echoes through stone walls and broken amps. We keep the Spanish soul intact, but wrap it in thunder and gothic grandeur.

---

## ⚡ _“Moonburn Requiem”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A bilingual doom-metal elegy in three acts: “The Shatter,” “The Silence,” and “The Rise.”*

---

### 🖤 I. THE SHATTER (Verse 1 – Spanish)

Lo siento, mi vida  
Ya sé que terminó  
Corazones rotos  
Esperanza se marchó  

Cuando brille la luna  
Sé que no dormirás  
Ni tú  
Ni yo  
Ya llegó el triste pesar  
Debemos separarnos  

---

### 🌒 II. THE SILENCE (Verse 2 – English)

The night you walked away  
Tore my soul in two  
Left me with a hollow flame  
And a sky that never knew  

I wait for dawn to break  
But the ache won’t fade  
I get so weak when the stars retreat  
And I think of you  
Still burning through  

---

### 🔥 III. THE BURN (Verse 3 – Spanish)

La noche que te fuiste  
Cambió mi pobre vida  
Quedó mi alma triste  
Pensando en mi herida  

Cuando brille la luna  
Sé que no dormirás  
Ni tú  
Ni yo  
Ya llegó el triste pesar  
Debemos separarnos  

---

### 🎸 IV. THE RISE (Bridge – English)

I’ll see it through  
Though the shadows scream  
Though the silence cuts  
Like a shattered dream  

I’ll rise again  
From the ash and flame  
But I’ll never forget  
Your name  

---

### 🌑 V. CODA (Final Verse – Spanish)

Lo siento, mi vida  
Ya sé que terminó  
Corazones rotos  
Esperanza se marchó  

Cuando brille la luna  
Sé que no dormirás  
Ni tú  
Ni yo  
Ya llegó el triste pesar  
Debemos separarnos  
Siempre… separar

Ronstrapp doesn’t just walk away—we stomp out, guitars blazing and amps bleeding. “You’re No Good” becomes _“Hexed and Gone”_—a venom-laced breakup anthem forged in the fires of betrayal and rebirth. We keep the bite, crank the distortion, and stretch it into a full metal opera of vengeance, regret, and unapologetic freedom.

---

## ⚡ _“Hexed and Gone”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A thrash-goth breakup saga in four movements: “The Scar,” “The Curse,” “The Reckoning,” and “The Exit.”*

---

### 🔥 I. THE SCAR (Verse 1)

Feeling stronger now that you’re ash  
Burned your name, tossed the match  
Lesson learned, yeah it cut me deep  
Now I see the wolf beneath the sheep  

---

### ⚔️ II. THE CURSE (Chorus)

You’re hexed  
You’re gone  
You’re poison in a song  
Baby, you’re no good  

Say it loud  
Say it raw  
You’re the wound beneath the claw  
Baby, you’re no good  

---

### 🩸 III. THE RECKONING (Verse 2)

I broke a heart that was pure and kind  
For a shadow like you, twisted and blind  
I’ll crawl back to the one I betrayed  
And beg forgiveness for the mess I made  

If he turns and walks away  
I’d deserve it anyway  
'Cause I became what I despised  
With you by my side  

---

### 🌑 IV. THE EXIT (Bridge)

I’m done with your games  
I’m done with your chains  
I’m carving my name  
In the walls of escape  

Forget your face  
Forget your flame  
I’m leaving for good  
No more shame  

---

### 🎸 V. FINAL CHORUS (Refrain)

You’re hexed  
You’re gone  
You’re poison in a song  
Baby, you’re no good  

Say it loud  
Say it raw  
You’re the wound beneath the claw  
Baby, you’re no good  

---

### 🕯️ VI. CODA (Outro)

Oh no  
Oh no  
You’re no good  
You’re no good  
You’re no good  

Baby, you’re no good  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronstrapp takes *“Poor Poor Pitiful Me”* and turns it into a riotous, theatrical metal banger called _“Wretched and Wild.”_ It’s part gallows humor, part battle cry—like if Joan Jett fronted a doom-glam band in a haunted cabaret. We lean into the absurdity, amplify the chaos, and give it a full arc of defiance and swagger.

---

## ⚡ _“Wretched and Wild”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A glam-thrash operetta in four acts: “The Curse,” “The Crush,” “The Chaos,” and “The Crown.”*

---

### 🎭 I. THE CURSE (Verse 1)

Laid my head on rusted steel  
Waiting for fate to seal the deal  
But the train don’t run this track no more  
Just echoes, ghosts, and metaphor  

---

### 🩸 II. THE CRUSH (Chorus)

Wretched and wild  
Wretched and wild  
Oh these boys, they drive me vile  
Saints above, I need reprieve  
Woe, woe—let me breathe  

---

### 🔥 III. THE CHAOS (Verse 2)

Met a man in Hollywood haze  
Not naming names, not counting days  
He worked me over, Jesse-style  
Left me spinning, bleeding, wild  

A blender set to “warfare mode”  
He stirred my soul, then hit the road  
A credit to his twisted kind  
Left me with a fractured mind  

---

### ⚔️ IV. THE CROWN (Verse 3)

Met a boy in Vieux Carré  
Or maybe it was Yokohama Bay  
He tossed me down, then begged for grace  
Said, “Don’t hurt me, mama,” face to face  

---

### 🎸 V. REPRISE (Chorus)

Wretched and wild  
Wretched and wild  
Oh these boys, they drive me vile  
Saints above, I need reprieve  
Woe, woe—let me breathe  

---

### 🌑 VI. CODA (Final Chant)

Wretched, wretched, wretched me  
Pitiful in poetry  
Wretched, wretched, wretched me  
Still dancing through catastrophe  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronstrapp takes *“Desperado”* and reforges it into _“Iron Rider”_—a gothic-western metal elegy for the lone soul who’s traded love for armor and wandered too long in the wasteland. It’s part outlaw myth, part emotional reckoning, wrapped in thunderous riffs and desert wind.

---

## ⚡ _“Iron Rider”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A doom-western metal ballad in five acts: “The Drift,” “The Cards,” “The Cold,” “The Gate,” and “The Warning.”*

---

### 🏜️ I. THE DRIFT (Verse 1)

Iron rider  
Why won’t you drop the mask?  
You’ve been chasing shadows  
Down rusted tracks  

You’re a hard one  
But I’ve seen the cracks  
The things you crave  
Will stab your back  

---

### ♠️ II. THE CARDS (Verse 2)

Don’t draw the queen of blades, my friend  
She’ll cut you clean, she won’t pretend  
The queen of ash is your only bet  

You’ve had gold laid at your feet  
But you chase ghosts you’ll never meet  
Always reaching for regret  

---

### ❄️ III. THE COLD (Verse 3)

Iron rider  
You’re not immortal, no  
Your hunger and your sorrow  
Are dragging you below  

And freedom?  
Just a tale they sell  
Your prison is the road  
You walk alone through hell  

---

### 🌑 IV. THE GATE (Verse 4)

Don’t your bones freeze in the winter wind?  
Sky won’t cry, and the light grows thin  
You can’t tell dusk from dawn these days  

You’ve lost the highs, you’ve drowned the lows  
Funny how the feeling goes  
Like smoke that won’t obey  

---

### 🌈 V. THE WARNING (Final Verse)

Iron rider  
Come down from your throne  
Open the gate  
You’re not alone  

It may be raining  
But there’s fire above  
You better let somebody love  
Let somebody love  
Before it’s too late  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronstrapp takes *“Don’t Know Much”* and transforms it into _“All I Know Is Fire”_—a soaring, symphonic metal ballad that trades soft sentiment for volcanic devotion. It’s vulnerable, yes—but wrapped in thunder, with strings and distortion rising like a phoenix behind every line. Think power-metal meets gothic romance, with a touch of operatic grandeur.

---

## ⚡ _“All I Know Is Fire”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A symphonic metal ballad in four acts: “The Mirror,” “The Wreckage,” “The Revelation,” and “The Flame.”*

---

### 🔥 I. THE MIRROR (Verse 1)

Look at this face  
The years carved deep  
Lines of war, lines of sleep  

Look at this life  
Still chasing flame  
No map, no crown, no name  

I don’t know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all I need to do  

---

### 🩸 II. THE WRECKAGE (Verse 2)

Look at these eyes  
Never saw what mattered  
Look at these dreams  
Torn and tattered  

I don’t know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all I need to do  

---

### 🌑 III. THE REVELATION (Bridge)

So many doors I never opened  
So many truths I never spoke  
But when you’re near, the fog is broken  
And I see the only truth I’ll ever know  
Is me and you  
In fire and shadow  

---

### ⚔️ IV. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)

Look at this soul  
Still begging for salvation  
Look at this man  
A storm of inspiration  

I don’t know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all I need to do  

I don’t know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all there is to do  

---

Let’s channel this Buddy Holly classic into a blistering glam-thrash anthem: _“Doesn’t Matter, Never Did”_ by Ronstrapp. It’s breakup rage with glitter and chains—think neon heartbreak meets double-kick fury. The lyrics get sharper, the guitars get louder, and the mascara runs like molten steel.

---

## ⚡ _“Doesn’t Matter, Never Did”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A glam-thrash breakup anthem in three acts: “The Cry,” “The Curse,” and “The Cut.”*

---

### 💔 I. THE CRY (Verse 1)

There you go, and baby—here I stand  
You left me wrecked with a drink in my hand  
Golly gee? Nah, more like hellfire spree  
But I guess it doesn’t matter—never did to me  

---

### 🧨 II. THE CURSE (Verse 2 + Bridge)

Do you remember last September?  
You swore forever with a kiss so tender  
Now I’m burning through your lies like gasoline  
You drove me mad, now I’m running clean  

No use crying, I’m done trying  
Tore up the nights, set fire to the days  
You were a ghost in glitter  
Now I’m dancing on your grave  

---

### ✂️ III. THE CUT (Verse 3 + Refrain)

You go your way, I’ll take the stage  
Now and forever, I’m done with your cage  
I’ll find someone new, someone true  
We’ll say “we’re through”—and I’ll mean it too  

You won’t matter anymore  
You never mattered before  
You won’t matter anymore  
You never mattered at all  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s reforge this tender ballad into a triumphant power-metal love anthem: _“All My Life (To Find You)”_ by Ronstrapp. It’s celestial, cinematic, and thunderously sincere—like a Valkyrie descending into a stadium of fire to declare eternal devotion. Think soaring vocals, orchestral swells, and guitar solos that sound like stars colliding.

---

## ⚡ _“All My Life (To Find You)”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A power-metal love anthem in three acts: “The Dream,” “The Prayer,” and “The Flame.”*

---

### 🌌 I. THE DREAM (Verse 1)

Am I really here in your arms?  
Feels like the stars aligned for me  
Time stands still, the world disarms  
And you're the only soul I see  

---

### 🙏 II. THE PRAYER (Verse 2 + Bridge)

I searched all my life for you  
Through shadow, storm, and flame  
I prayed to skies for something true  
And then your angel came  

I never knew how love could burn  
Never dared to let it show  
But now my heart is battle-worn  
And yours is all I know  

---

### 🔥 III. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)

I never thought I'd feel this fire  
Never thought I'd let it grow  
But now my soul is on the wire  
And this love will never go  

Hey, I’ve searched all my life for you  
And now you’re here  
Hey, I’ll spend all my life with you  
All my life  
All my life  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronstrapp takes *“Someone to Lay Down Beside Me”* and transforms it into _“The Story of My Knife”_—a gothic-glam metal ballad about longing, illusion, and the ache for connection in a world that trades love for shadows. It’s tender, tragic, and thunderously theatrical—like a velvet dagger wrapped in distortion.

---

## ⚡ _“The Story of My Knife”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A glam-goth metal elegy in three acts: “The Street,” “The Flame,” and “The Morning.”*

---

### 🌃 I. THE STREET (Verse 1)

There’s someone waiting  
Alone in the rain  
For a stranger to whisper their name  

Here you are  
In the city of glass  
Where love fades fast  
And no one asks  

Lonely eyes  
Stare through yours at night  
And they say:  

---

### 🩸 II. THE FLAME (Verse 2 + Chorus)

Woman, sweet woman  
Come home with me  
You shine like fire  
You move like free  

But your love  
Is a flickering flame  
Not the kind  
That carves a name  

Still maybe that’s what I need  

Someone to lay down beside me  
Even if it’s not real  
Just someone to lay down beside me  
You’re the story of my knife  

---

### 🌑 III. THE MORNING (Verse 3 + Refrain)

Morning breaks  
Street lights die  
The sun reveals  
What we deny  

This world’s a mirror  
Cold and heartless  
Not like the love  
I feel in my darkness  

Still maybe that’s all we get  

Someone to lay down beside you  
Even if it’s not real  
Just someone to lay down beside you  
You just can’t ask for more  

---


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s crank this gospel standard into a full-throttle metal epic: _“Mountain of Fire”_ by Ronstrapp. Think Iron Maiden meets Johnny Cash in a cathedral made of steel and thunder. The train is no longer a gentle metaphor—it’s a roaring, flame-belching beast barreling toward transcendence.

---

## 🔥 _“Mountain of Fire”_ — by Ronstrapp  
*A gospel-metal anthem in five movements: “Throttle,” “Trestle,” “Union,” “Arrival,” and “Forevermore.”*

---

### 🚂 I. THROTTLE (Verse 1)

Life is like a mountain railway  
Steel and fire, brave and bold  
From the cradle to the graveway  
Ride the track that can't be sold  

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels  
Never falter, never fail  
Grip the throttle like a hammer  
Keep your eyes upon the rail  

---

### ✝️ II. TRESTLE (Verse 2)

Blessed Savior, guide the engine  
Through the storm and through the flame  
Angels ride the burning trestle  
Calling out your sacred name  

As you cross the tide of Jordan  
Hear the thunder, feel the roar  
You will reach the final station  
Where the gates no longer close  

---

### 🛤️ III. UNION (Verse 3)

At the Union Depot waiting  
God the Father, God the Son  
With a choir of roaring engines  
Singing, “Weary one, well done!”  

---

### 🌅 IV. ARRIVAL (Chorus)

Blessed Savior there to guide us  
Till we reach that blazing shore  
And the angels there beside us  
In God's grace forevermore  

---

### 🔁 V. FOREVERMORE (Outro)

In God's grace forevermore  
In God's grace forevermore  
Let the mountain burn behind you  
As the train begins to soar  

---
