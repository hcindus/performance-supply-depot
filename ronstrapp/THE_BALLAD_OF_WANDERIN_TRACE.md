**[Intro – Spoken, with a slow banjo pluck]**

Gather 'round the fire, y'all, and lend an ear,
To a tale from these hills, where secrets run clear.
In a hollow so deep, where the whippoorwill sings,
Folks with their stories, tied up in strings.

---

**[Verse 1 – The Merchant's Journey]**

Down the mountain trail came a merchant one day,
With a mule full of goods and a banjo to play,
Silks from the lowlands, spices so fine,
He sang of far rivers where the sun don't shine.

His eyes held a sparkle, his voice like a stream,
Told tales of the ocean, made the young'uns dream.
But when he packed up, 'neath the sycamore tree,
He left more'n his wares—oh, a memory free,
A whisper of wonder, a song in the air,
The merchant's sweet echo, still lingerin' there.

---

**[Chorus – Banjo picks up, lively]**

Oh, the banjo keeps strummin', the tale rolls along,
In these ol' smoky hills, where we sing our song,
From the hollow to the ridge, where the secrets take hold,
This Appalachian yarn, worth more'n gold!

---

**[Verse 2 – The Merchant's Secret]**

In a cabin down low, by the crick's gentle flow,
Lived a gal with a smile that the wildflowers know,
The merchant, he lingered, one moonlit night,
Shared a dance with that gal 'neath the firefly light.

Come mornin' he was gone, left her heart in a whirl,
But nine months later, she bore a lil' girl.
Hair like the sunrise, eyes sharp as a hawk,
The merchant's own mark in the way she'd talk,
Ol' Farmer John claimed her, never knew the truth,
A secret kept quiet in her mountain youth.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the banjo keeps strummin', the tale rolls along,
In these ol' smoky hills, where we sing our song,
From the hollow to the ridge, where the secrets take hold,
This Appalachian yarn, worth more'n gold!

---

**[Verse 3 – The Blacksmith's Fire]**

Up on the ridge, where the pine trees stand tall,
Lived a blacksmith named Caleb, strongest of all,
His hammer'd ring out, like a whippoorwill's call,
But his heart burned hotter than the forge in his hall.

The farmer's young wife, she'd slip through the glen,
To the glow of that forge, where she'd meet him again,
Sparks flew like magic, their love a bright flame,
But secrets in these hills don't stay the same.
Farmer kept plowin', but the whispers did grow,
And fate came a-callin'—a hard row to hoe.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the banjo keeps strummin', the tale rolls along,
In these ol' smoky hills, where we sing our song,
From the hollow to the ridge, where the secrets take hold,
This Appalachian yarn, worth more'n gold!

---

**[Verse 4 – The Rollin' Gal]**

Now there's a gal in these hills, free as the breeze,
Rollin' through hollers, doin' just as she please,
They call her the Wanderin' Rose, with a laugh so bright,
She'd dance with the merchant 'neath the starry night.

Then to the blacksmith, her heart she'd lend,
But never stayed long—she'd roll 'round the bend,
The butcher'd holler, the fiddler'd sigh,
"Wanderin' Rose, why you passin' us by?"
She'd just keep rollin', with a song in her soul,
Leavin' love in her wake, but never a toll.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the banjo keeps strummin', the tale rolls along,
In these ol' smoky hills, where we sing our song,
From the hollow to the ridge, where the secrets take hold,
This Appalachian yarn, worth more'n gold!

---

**[Verse 5 – The Farmer's Quiet]**

Farmer John worked his land, from dawn 'til the dark,
His hands in the soil, but a pain in his heart,
He knew 'bout the blacksmith, the merchant, and more,
Saw the Wanderin' Rose comin' 'round his door.

But he kept to his plow, with a smile so sly,
Never let on 'bout the tears in his eye,
Folks called him simple, said he didn't know,
But John held the truth, like the roots down below,
He'd hum an ol' hymn, let the mountain winds sing,
A quiet ol' man, with the wisdom of kings.

---

**[Bridge – Banjo slows, mournful]**

In these hills, where the shadows fall deep,
Every tale's got a promise that the mountains keep,
Love may wander, and secrets may burn,
But the banjo'll play 'til the seasons turn.

---

**[Chorus]**

Oh, the banjo keeps strummin', the tale rolls along,
In these ol' smoky hills, where we sing our song,
From the hollow to the ridge, where the secrets take hold,
This Appalachian yarn, worth more'n gold!

---

**[Outro – Banjo fades out]**

So raise up your voice, let the mountain air ring,
For the merchant, the blacksmith, and the farmer who'd sing,
Wanderin' Rose still rolls through the glen,
And these hills'll tell their tale—again and again.
