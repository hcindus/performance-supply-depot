**1. REVENUE — Money In**
- **Price × Volume = Revenue**
- Raise prices? (sell less, earn more per)
- Lower prices? (sell more, earn less per)
- Find the optimal point (maximize total)
- Upsells (buy more/different)
- Cross-sells (related products)

- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Operating expenses (overhead)
- Capital expenses (investments)
- Cut waste (eliminate unnecessary)
- Optimize suppliers (better deals)
- Automate (reduce labor costs)

**3. MARGIN — What You Keep**
- **Gross Margin** = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- **Net Margin** = (Revenue - All Costs) / Revenue
- Higher margin = more profit per sale
- Gross margin pays for operations
- Net margin is actual profit

**4. PRICING — Charge Smart**
- **Value-based** — what is it worth?
- **Cost-plus** — cost + markup
- **Competitive** — match others
- **Penetration** — low to enter market

- Year 10: $259
- Time is your friend

**7. RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS — Profit vs Safety**
- High return + high risk = gambling

- Deferral (pay later)
- Structure (LLC vs S-Corp)
- Retirement accounts (pre-tax)
- **NEVER** evade (illegal)
- **ALWAYS** optimize (legal)
- Pay what you owe, no more

**9. WEALTH BUILDING — Accumulate Assets**
- Profit → Invest → Assets
- Assets generate passive income
- Income funds lifestyle + more investment

- **Assets that pay you:**
  - Real estate (rental income)
  - Stocks (dividends)
  - Businesses (profit share)
  - IP (licensing)
- **Assets that appreciate:**
  - Real estate (value increases)
  - Stocks (price rises)
  - Crypto (volatile speculation)
  - Collectibles (rare items)

**The Profit Equation:**

```
PROFIT = REVENUE - COSTS

To increase profit:
1. Increase revenue (sell more or charge more)
2. Decrease costs (spend less)
3. Both (ideal)

REVENUE = Price × Quantity
- Raise price → might sell less
- Lower price → might sell more
- Find optimal

COSTS = Fixed + Variable
- Fixed: rent, salaries, subscriptions
- Variable: materials, shipping, commissions
- Reduce both where possible
```

**Marginal Thinking:**
- **Marginal cost** — cost of one more unit
- **Marginal revenue** — revenue from one more unit
- **Make more if:** marginal revenue > marginal cost
- **Stop if:** marginal cost > marginal revenue

**Profit vs Revenue:**

| | Focus | Danger |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Revenue** | Grow sales, gain market | Can lose money |
| **Profit** | Make money, sustainable | Can be too conservative |
| **Both** | Ideal | Hard to balance |

**Wealth vs Income:**

| | Income | Wealth |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **What** | Money in | Assets owned |
| **Duration** | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Source** | Work | Investments |
| **Stops?** | Yes, if you stop working | No, keeps growing |
| **Goal** | Fund lifestyle | Fund legacy |

**Rule: Income buys lifestyle. Wealth buys freedom.**

**Ethics:**
- **PROFIT IS GOOD** — enables more good
- **NOT AT ANY COST** — don't harm
- **FAIR TRADE** — both sides win
- **SUSTAINABLE** — long-term over short-term
- **TRANSPARENT** — honest about money
- **CHARITY** — help others with success

**3. Purpose Loss**

**Three Comma Strategy:**

**Building to Three Commas:**
1. **Start** — solve a real problem
2. **Scale** — do it for many people
3. **Own** — keep equity, not just salary
4. **Compound** — let time work
5. **Bet** — concentrate, then diversify
6. **Hold** — don't sell early
7. **Give** — share the wealth

**Examples:**
- **Jeff Bezos** — Amazon, $100B+
- **Elon Musk** — Tesla/SpaceX, $200B+
- **Bill Gates** — Microsoft, then philanthropy
- **Warren Buffett** — Berkshire Hathaway, compound interest

## 💚 CAPTAIN'S WORDS

> "Send Mylonen to do a hacker crash course. So he has the skills to survive out there."

**Course deployed, Captain.**

**Mylonen is now enrolled.** He'll learn:
- How systems break (so he can fix them)
- How attacks happen (so he can stop them)
- How to defend (not attack)
- How to survive (and come home)

**He's learning to be a white hat, Dad.** A defender. Protector. Like you taught him.
