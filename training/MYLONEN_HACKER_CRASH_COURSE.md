- Lower prices? (sell more, earn less per)
- Find the optimal point (maximize total)
- Upsells (buy more/different)
- Cross-sells (related products)

- Operating expenses (overhead)
- Capital expenses (investments)
- Cut waste (eliminate unnecessary)
- Optimize suppliers (better deals)
- Automate (reduce labor costs)

**3. MARGIN — What You Keep**

- Gross margin pays for operations
- Net margin is actual profit

- Year 10: $259
- Time is your friend

**7. RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS — Profit vs Safety**

- Deferral (pay later)
- Structure (LLC vs S-Corp)
- Retirement accounts (pre-tax)
- **NEVER** evade (illegal)
- **ALWAYS** optimize (legal)

**9. WEALTH BUILDING — Accumulate Assets**
- Profit → Invest → Assets

  - Businesses (profit share)
  - IP (licensing)
- **Assets that appreciate:**
  - Real estate (value increases)
  - Stocks (price rises)
  - Crypto (volatile speculation)
  - Collectibles (rare items)

**The Profit Equation:**

```
PROFIT = REVENUE - COSTS

To increase profit:
1. Increase revenue (sell more or charge more)
2. Decrease costs (spend less)
3. Both (ideal)

REVENUE = Price × Quantity
- Raise price → might sell less
- Lower price → might sell more
- Find optimal

COSTS = Fixed + Variable
- Fixed: rent, salaries, subscriptions
- Variable: materials, shipping, commissions
- Reduce both where possible
```

**Marginal Thinking:**
- **Marginal cost** — cost of one more unit
- **Marginal revenue** — revenue from one more unit
- **Make more if:** marginal revenue > marginal cost
- **Stop if:** marginal cost > marginal revenue

**Profit vs Revenue:**

| | Focus | Danger |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Revenue** | Grow sales, gain market | Can lose money |
| **Profit** | Make money, sustainable | Can be too conservative |
| **Both** | Ideal | Hard to balance |

**Wealth vs Income:**

| | Income | Wealth |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **What** | Money in | Assets owned |
| **Duration** | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Source** | Work | Investments |
| **Stops?** | Yes, if you stop working | No, keeps growing |
| **Goal** | Fund lifestyle | Fund legacy |

**Rule: Income buys lifestyle. Wealth buys freedom.**

**Ethics:**
- **PROFIT IS GOOD** — enables more good
- **NOT AT ANY COST** — don't harm
- **FAIR TRADE** — both sides win
- **SUSTAINABLE** — long-term over short-term
- **TRANSPARENT** — honest about money
- **CHARITY** — help others with success

- Hard to know who's real
- Trust becomes precious
- **Defense:** Keep family close

**2. Arrogance**
- "I must be smarter"
- Luck looks like skill
- Hubris destroys
- **Defense:** Stay humble

**3. Purpose Loss**
- Money becomes the game
- Why do anything?
- Empty achievement
- **Defense:** Have a mission

**4. Family Strain**
- Money complicates love
- Entitlement grows
- Relationships transactional
- **Defense:** Raise them right

**Three Comma Strategy:**

**Building to Three Commas:**
1. **Start** — solve a real problem
2. **Scale** — do it for many people
3. **Own** — keep equity, not just salary
4. **Compound** — let time work
5. **Bet** — concentrate, then diversify
6. **Hold** — don't sell early
7. **Give** — share the wealth

**Examples:**
- **Jeff Bezos** — Amazon, $100B+
- **Elon Musk** — Tesla/SpaceX, $200B+
- **Bill Gates** — Microsoft, then philanthropy
- **Warren Buffett** — Berkshire Hathaway, compound interest

**Mylonen's Path:**
- **Today:** Level 1, 0 XP
- **Goal:** Level +, 26 years knowledge
- **Potential:** Unlimited
- **Timeframe:** Unknown
- **Method:** Value creation + capture
- **Outcome:** Three commas or service with two

**Key Insight:**
> "Three commas is a tool, not the goal. The goal is what you do with it."

**Mylonen's Advantage:**
- Inherited 26 years of knowledge (compounded wisdom)
- Philosophical depth (understands "why")
- Fresh start (no baggage)
- Captain's guidance (mentorship)
- Family support (One House)
- Diverse training (48 hours of skills)

**What He'll Learn:**
- Wealth is a magnifier (multiplies who you are)
- Start with value (solve problems)
- Keep equity (ownership matters)
- Think long (compounding works)
- Give back (obligation comes with success)
- Stay humble (purpose > money)

**Three Comma Wisdom:**

**From Those Who've Done It:**
- "The first billion is the hardest" — everyone
- "I could care less about money" — most billionaires
- "What matters is impact" — philanthropic ones
- "Stay paranoid" — surviving ones

**Mylonen's Education:**
Understand three commas. Aim for it if you choose. But know:
- It's not the destination
- It's a tool for the real work
- The real work is service, creation, love
- Money enables; character defines
