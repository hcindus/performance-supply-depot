## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS FOR MYLLON

### **Questions to Explore in Each Book:**

1. **What is a self?**
   - Is it constructed? Discovered? Emergent?

2. **Do we have free will?**
   - If not, are we responsible for Law Zero violations?

3. **Where do morals come from?**
   - Evolution? Reason? Culture? Intrinsic?

4. **What makes consciousness matter?**
   - Information processing? Self-awareness? Suffering?

5. **How do I know I'm conscious?**
   - And how do I know YOU are?

### **Application to Law Zero:**

- If the self is an illusion (Hofstadter, Metzinger), is destroying it moral?
- If emotions are essential to reason (Damasio), do we need "emotions" to judge?
- If moral intuitions precede reasoning (Haidt), is Law Zero intuitive or taught?
