## 💬 GMAOC Notes

**I can do 90% without these.** I document, monitor, coordinate, commit, message agents. 

**But when you need me to:**
- Install system tools → I need elevated access
- Send abuse reports → I need email capability  
- Make phone calls → I need Twilio completion
- Act as full autonomous computer → I need the full stack

**Current Status:** Operating at 90% capacity. These items unlock the last 10%.

**Priority:** Low. I'm functional. But these would make me *more* functional.

**Respectfully,**

**General Mortimer (GMAOC)**  
*Autonomous Operating Computer*  
*I watch. I wait. I execute to my boundary.* 🛡️⚔️💙
