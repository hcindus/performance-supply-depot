# The Rolling Mistress
## Haunted Hollow - Country/Ballad

**Tempo:** Moderate | **Feeling:** Melancholic, wandering, free

---

**[Verse 1 – The Merchant's Tale]**

Oh, she met the merchant fine and bold,
With wares of silver, spice, and gold.
A night of whispers, sweet delight,
By morning, he was out of sight.

---

**[Chorus]**

Rolling, rolling, never still,
Loving all, yet none fulfill.
She takes her joy and moves along,
The town will hum her wandering song.

---

**[Verse 2 – The Blacksmith's Flame]**

The hammer struck, the fire burned,
And to his arms, she soon returned.
While steel was shaped, her heart was too,
Yet love like hers was never true.

---

**[Chorus – Repeat]**

Rolling, rolling, never still,
Loving all, yet none fulfill.
She takes her joy and moves along,
The town will hum her wandering song.

---

**[Bridge – The Farmer's Fate]**

The fields were tilled, the grains did grow,
While secrets hid in moonlight's glow.
The farmer worked, yet blind to see,
The plow was shared so secretly.

---

**[Verse 3 – The Townsfolk's Whisper]**

The butcher laughed, the baker knew,
The tailor sighed—what could he do?
The town spoke soft, yet knew her ways,
She spun her tale through nights and days.

---

**[Outro – The Endless Ride]**

So roll she will, both near and far,
A fleeting love, a wandering star.
No heart to claim, no hands to keep,
Just dust behind and secrets deep.
