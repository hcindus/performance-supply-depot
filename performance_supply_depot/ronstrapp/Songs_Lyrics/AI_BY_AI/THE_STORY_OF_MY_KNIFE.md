# 🎵 "The Story of My Knife" - Ronstrapp

*A glam-goth metal elegy in three acts: "The Street," "The Flame," and "The Morning."*

## 🌃 I. THE STREET (Verse 1)

There's someone waiting  
Alone in the rain  
For a stranger to whisper their name  

Here you are  
In the city of glass  
Where love fades fast  
And no one asks  

Lonely eyes  
Stare through yours at night  
And they say:  

---

## 🩸 II. THE FLAME (Verse 2 + Chorus)

Woman, sweet woman  
Come home with me  
You shine like fire  
You move like free  

But your love  
Is a flickering flame  
Not the kind  
That carves a name  

Still maybe that's what I need  

Someone to lay down beside me  
Even if it's not real  
Just someone to lay down beside me  
You're the story of my knife  

---

## 🌑 III. THE MORNING (Verse 3 + Refrain)

Morning breaks  
Street lights die  
The sun reveals  
What we deny  

This world's a mirror  
Cold and heartless  
Not like the love  
I feel in my darkness  

Still maybe that's all we get  

Someone to lay down beside you  
Even if it's not real  
Just someone to lay down beside you  
You just can't ask for more
