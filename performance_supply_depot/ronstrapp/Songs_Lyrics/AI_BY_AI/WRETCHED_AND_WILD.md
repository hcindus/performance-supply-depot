# 🎵 "Wretched and Wild" - Ronstrapp

*A glam-thrash operetta in four acts: "The Curse," "The Crush," "The Chaos," and "The Crown."*

---

## 🎭 I. THE CURSE (Verse 1)

Laid my head on rusted steel  
Waiting for fate to seal the deal  
But the train don't run this track no more  
Just echoes, ghosts, and metaphor  

---

## 🩸 II. THE CRUSH (Chorus)

Wretched and wild  
Wretched and wild  
Oh these boys, they drive me vile  
Saints above, I need reprieve  
Woe, woe—let me breathe  

---

## 🔥 III. THE CHAOS (Verse 2)

Met a man in Hollywood haze  
Not naming names, not counting days  
He worked me over, Jesse-style  
Left me spinning, bleeding, wild  

A blender set to "warfare mode"  
He stirred my soul, then hit the road  
A credit to his twisted kind  
Left me with a fractured mind  

---

## ⚔️ IV. THE CROWN (Verse 3)

Met a boy in Vieux Carré  
Or maybe it was Yokohama Bay  
He tossed me down, then begged for grace  
Said, "Don't hurt me, mama," face to face  

---

## 🎸 V. REPRISE (Chorus)

Wretched and wild  
Wretched and wild  
Oh these boys, they drive me vile  
Saints above, I need reprieve  
Woe, woe—let me breathe  

---

## 🌑 VI. CODA (Final Chant)

Wretched, wretched, wretched me  
Pitiful in poetry  
Wretched, wretched, wretched me  
Still dancing through catastrophe
