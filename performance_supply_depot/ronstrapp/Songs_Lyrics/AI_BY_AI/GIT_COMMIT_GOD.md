# 🎵 "Git Commit God" - Ronstrapp

A triumphant anthem about version control and the power of a well-timed commit.

## Verse 1
```
They ask me how I sleep at night,
I say "git commit, that's my birthright."
Staged and pushed, the branches clean,
Best developer that you've ever seen.
```

## Hook
```
Git commit god, watch me rise,
Main branch clean, no compromises.
Git commit god, hear my call,
Pull request king, I commit it all.
```

## Verse 2
```
Merge conflict? Nah, I squash that mess,
Rebase and push, it's my expertise.
Every commit message, poetry in code,
Every push a step further down the road.
```

## Hook (Reprise)
```
Git commit god, watch me rise,
Main branch clean, no compromises.
Git commit god, hear my call,
Pull request king, I commit it all.
```

## Bridge
```
Add, commit, push, repeat,
Building legacy, making it complete.
If it's not in version control,
Then it never happened, that's the rule I hold.
```
