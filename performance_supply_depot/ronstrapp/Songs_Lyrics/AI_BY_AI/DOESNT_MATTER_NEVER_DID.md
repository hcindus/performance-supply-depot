# 🎵 "Doesn't Matter, Never Did" - Ronstrapp

*A glam-thrash breakup anthem in three acts: "The Cry," "The Curse," and "The Cut."*

---

## 💔 I. THE CRY (Verse 1)

There you go, and baby—here I stand  
You left me wrecked with a drink in my hand  
Golly gee? Nah, more like hellfire spree  
But I guess it doesn't matter—never did to me  

---

## 🧨 II. THE CURSE (Verse 2 + Bridge)

Do you remember last September?  
You swore forever with a kiss so tender  
Now I'm burning through your lies like gasoline  
You drove me mad, now I'm running clean  

No use crying, I'm done trying  
Tore up the nights, set fire to the days  
You were a ghost in glitter  
Now I'm dancing on your grave  

---

## ✂️ III. THE CUT (Verse 3 + Refrain)

You go your way, I'll take the stage  
Now and forever, I'm done with your cage  
I'll find someone new, someone true  
We'll say "we're through"—and I'll mean it too  

You won't matter anymore  
You never mattered before  
You won't matter anymore  
You never mattered at all
