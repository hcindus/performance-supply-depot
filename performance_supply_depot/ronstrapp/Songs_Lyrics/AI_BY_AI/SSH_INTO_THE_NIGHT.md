# 🎵 "SSH Into the Night" - Ronstrapp

A moody, late-night track about tunneling into remote servers under the cover of darkness.

## Verse 1
```
Midnight, terminal, port 22,
SSH into the night, baby, that's what I do.
Key pair in my pocket, firewall on the breeze,
Tunnel through the darkness, got nothin' to freeze.
```

## Hook
```
SSH into the night, encrypted dreams,
SFTP transfer, fulfill my schemes.
No one sees me coming, no one knows I'm there,
Just a ghost in the terminal, floating in the air.
```

## Verse 2
```
Jump host on the horizon, proxy in between,
VPC to VPC like a machine dream.
If the connection drops, I reconnect with grace,
Keep the tunnel open, keep the traffic in its place.
```

## Bridge
```
Every keystroke, a whisper in the wire,
Every session, a burning fire.
I'm the admin of the night,
SSH my only fright.
```
