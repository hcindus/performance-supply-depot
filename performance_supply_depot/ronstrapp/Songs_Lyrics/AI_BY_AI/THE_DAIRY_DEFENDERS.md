## 🎵 Lyrics

**(Intro - Chiptune Fanfare)**
*(8-bit trumpets, retro drums)*

**DOO-WOP CHORUS:** (Background vocals)
🎵 *"Moo! Moo! Moo!"* 🎵

---

**(Verse 1 - Moderate tempo, heroic)**

In the land of Dairyopolis, where the cows all roam free
There's a hero in a milk truck, as brave as can be
He's not *blue* cheese, he's the *cream* of the crop
With a bottle full of justice and a mooooooooo-bile shop!

**CHORUS:** (Triumphant, belt it out)
🎵 *"MILK MAN! (MOO!)* 🐄
*Defending dairy since 1953! (CHEESE!)* 🧀
*Don't be a Larry and slack on your Dairy*
*He's pasteurizing crime with style and flair!"* 🎵

---

**(Verse 2 - Fast, introducing sidekick)**

But he's not alone, there's a partner in the fray
Boy Lactate by his side, saving the day!
He's got gadgets, he's got gizmos, he's got lactose-powered tools
Together they're *gouda*, breaking all the rules!

**CHORUS:**
🎵 *"BOY LACTATE! (MOO!)*
*The sidekick with the dairy-fresh attitude! (CREAM!)*
*Don't be a Larry and slack on your Dairy*
*These heroes are *feta* than the rest, it's true!"* 🎵

---

**(Bridge - Slow down, dramatic)**

When Vil Laine threatens with his lactose-eliminating schemes
And the city's in danger, shattered cream-dairy dreams
One man rises from The Creamery, cape and all
Standing ten feet tall... well, mostly tall!

**(Pause for effect)**
**(Build up)**

**CHORUS - FULL BAND:**
🎵 *"MILK MAN AND BOY LACTATE! (MOO! MOO!)*
*The Dairy Defenders of Dairyopolis! (YOGURT!)* 🥛
*Don't be a Larry and slack on your Dairy*
*'Cause justice never spoils, and neither do they!"* 🎵

---

**(Outro - Fast, upbeat)**

**DOO-WOP CHORUS:**
🎵 *"Moo! Moo! MILK! Man!* 🐄
*Don't be a Larry! (Don't be a Larry!)*
*Slack on your Dairy! (Slack on your Dairy!)"* 🎵

**(Final chord - Big finish)**
**MILK MAN!** 🥛✨

## 🎨 BR-01 Artistic Direction (Tappy's Notes)

**The Vibe:** 1950s milkman meets 80s superhero cartoon

**Imagine:**
- Opening sequence: Milk truck transforming into Milkmobile
- Black-and-white footage turning to color
- Milk Man and Boy Lactate striking heroic poses in dairy aisle
- Villain silhouettes in background
- Epic theme plays

**"Happy Little Sounds" Philosophy:**
- Make the "Moo!" vocals actually sound joyful
- Add bottle clinks as percussion (subtle)
- Include the sound of a milk truck engine idling in intro
- Outro should sound like a satisfied sip of cold milk

**Visual Reference:**
- 1950s dairy commercials
- Adam West Batman TV opening
- 8-bit game title screens
- The "Power Rangers" morphing sequence energy
