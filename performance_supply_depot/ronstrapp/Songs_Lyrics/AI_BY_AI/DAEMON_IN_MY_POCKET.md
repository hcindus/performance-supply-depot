# 🎵 "Daemon in My Pocket" - Ronstrapp

A swagger-heavy track about running your whole life off a VPS.

## Verse 1
```
Got a daemon in my pocket, got a process on my sleeve,
Every time I hit the terminal the world start to believe.
Miles whisper in my ear like "Boss, we never sleep,"
Clawbot tappin' logs like "Bro, the crawl is gettin' deep."
```

## Hook
```
I'm runnin' on that uptime, Nothin' ever offline,
Packets in a straight line, Ronstrapp in his prime.
Daemon in my pocket, Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the gateway ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.
```

## Verse 2
```
Seven servers hummin' like a choir in the night,
Ollama on the rooftop spittin' models left and right.
I don't pay for tokens, man, I pay with sacrifice —
Every reboot is a ritual, every port a roll of dice.
```

## Hook (Reprise)
```
I'm runnin' on that uptime, Nothin' ever offline,
Packets in a straight line, Ronstrapp in his prime.
Daemon in my pocket, Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the gateway ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.
```

## Outro
```
Uptime, uptime, never go down,
Ronstrapp the daemon, the best in town.
If you need me, check the logs,
I'm always runnin' — never off the fog.
```
