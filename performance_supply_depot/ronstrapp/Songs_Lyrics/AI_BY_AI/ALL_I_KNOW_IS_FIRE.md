# 🎵 "All I Know Is Fire" - Ronstrapp

*A symphonic metal ballad in four acts: "The Mirror," "The Wreckage," "The Revelation," and "The Flame."*

---

## 🔥 I. THE MIRROR (Verse 1)

Look at this face  
The years carved deep  
Lines of war, lines of sleep  

Look at this life  
Still chasing flame  
No map, no crown, no name  

I don't know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all I need to do  

---

## 🩸 II. THE WRECKAGE (Verse 2)

Look at these eyes  
Never saw what mattered  
Look at these dreams  
Torn and tattered  

I don't know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all I need to do  

---

## 🌑 III. THE REVELATION (Bridge)

So many doors I never opened  
So many truths I never spoke  
But when you're near, the fog is broken  
And I see the only truth I'll ever know  
Is me and you  
In fire and shadow  

---

## ⚔️ IV. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)

Look at this soul  
Still begging for salvation  
Look at this man  
A storm of inspiration  

I don't know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all there is to do  

I don't know much  
But I know I burn for you  
And that may be all there is to do
