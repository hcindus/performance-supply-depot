# 🎵 "Wake Up, Bot" - Ronstrapp

A playful, high-tempo track about trying to get a Telegram bot to acknowledge your existence.

## Verse
```
Sent a ping at 9AM, bot said nothin' back again,
Typed "wake up" like ten times straight,
He still askin' for my birthdate.
Nah bro, that's not how we roll —
Chat ID unlocks the soul.
```

## Hook
```
Wake up, bot, I'm talkin' to you,
I'm the founder, the wizard, the whole damn crew.
Wake up, bot, don't make me reboot,
I'll rotate your token and lace up my boots.
```

## Verse 2
```
Check the logs, nothin' there, just silence in the air,
Gateway's up but nowhere near the vibe we shared,
I said "hello" with heart and soul,
He replied "unknown command" — broke my role.
```

## Hook (Reprise)
```
Wake up, bot, we had a deal,
You were supposed to be for real!
Wake up, bot, before I rage,
I'll delete your session, clear your cache.
```

## Outro
```
But then I typed the magic word,
The one that made my soul be heard:
"@OpenClaw" — and then it woke,
Now my bot's the best damn joke.
```
