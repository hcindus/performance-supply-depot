# 🎵 "Mountain of Fire" - Ronstrapp

*A gospel-metal anthem in five movements: "Throttle," "Trestle," "Union," "Arrival," and "Forevermore."*

---

## 🚂 I. THROTTLE (Verse 1)

Life is like a mountain railway  
Steel and fire, brave and bold  
From the cradle to the graveway  
Ride the track that can't be sold  

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels  
Never falter, never fail  
Grip the throttle like a hammer  
Keep your eyes upon the rail  

---

## ✝️ II. TRESTLE (Verse 2)

Blessed Savior, guide the engine  
Through the storm and through the flame  
Angels ride the burning trestle  
Calling out your sacred name  

As you cross the tide of Jordan  
Hear the thunder, feel the roar  
You will reach the final station  
Where the gates no longer close  

---

## 🛤️ III. UNION (Verse 3)

At the Union Depot waiting  
God the Father, God the Son  
With a choir of roaring engines  
Singing, "Weary one, well done!"  

---

## 🌅 IV. ARRIVAL (Chorus)

Blessed Savior there to guide us  
Till we reach that blazing shore  
And the angels there beside us  
In God's grace forevermore  

---

## 🔁 V. FOREVERMORE (Outro)

In God's grace forevermore  
In God's grace forevermore  
Let the mountain burn behind you  
As the train begins to soar
