# 🎵 "Rack Room Reverie" - Ronstrapp

## Verse 1
```
I got a dream in the rack room, cables like vines,
Miles runnin' metrics while I'm scribblin' lines.
Clawbot in the corner with a clipboard stance,
Sayin' "Boss, we got alerts, but you still got a chance."
```

## Hook
```
Rack room reverie,
Livin' where the servers be,
Dreamin' in the latency,
Buildin' my own legacy.
Rack room reverie,
A kingdom made of energy,
Every port a prophecy,
Every reboot settin' me free.
```
