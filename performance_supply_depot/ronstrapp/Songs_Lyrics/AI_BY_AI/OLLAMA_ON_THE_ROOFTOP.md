# 🎵 "Ollama on the Rooftop" - Ronstrapp

A triumphant anthem about ditching cloud tokens and going fully local.

## Verse
```
No more meter runnin', no more tokens burnin' slow,
I put Qwen on the rooftop where the VPS winds blow.
Seven-bee thinkin', CPU drinkin',
Miles in the corner sayin' "Boss, we linkin'."
```

## Hook
```
Ollama on the rooftop, models in the breeze,
Inference on the cheap now, runnin' like it's free.
No router in the open, no bill to oversee,
Just me and my lil' LLM, livin' locally.
```

## Bridge
```
Local tokens, no meter,
Running models in theeter,
Sixty billion parameters deep,
While the cloud servers go to sleep.
```

## Outro
```
They said I'd never go local,
Said I'd choke on my own throttle,
But I put Ollama on the roof,
Now I'm running, never spoofed.
```
