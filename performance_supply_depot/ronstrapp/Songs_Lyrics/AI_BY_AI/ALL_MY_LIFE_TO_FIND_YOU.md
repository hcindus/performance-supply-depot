# 🎵 "All My Life (To Find You)" - Ronstrapp

*A power-metal love anthem in three acts: "The Dream," "The Prayer," and "The Flame."*

---

## 🌌 I. THE DREAM (Verse 1)

Am I really here in your arms?  
Feels like the stars aligned for me  
Time stands still, the world disarms  
And you're the only soul I see  

---

## 🙏 II. THE PRAYER (Verse 2 + Bridge)

I searched all my life for you  
Through shadow, storm, and flame  
I prayed to skies for something true  
And then your angel came  

I never knew how love could burn  
Never dared to let it show  
But now my heart is battle-worn  
And yours is all I know  

---

## 🔥 III. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)

I never thought I'd feel this fire  
Never thought I'd let it grow  
But now my soul is on the wire  
And this love will never go  

Hey, I've searched all my life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you  
All my life  
All my life
