## 1. RACK ROOM REVERIE (Intro)

*(Spoken word over humming server fans)*

```
You ever fall asleep to the sound of a heartbeat that ain't yours?
That low, steady hum of a machine that believes in you more than people do?
Yeah…
Welcome to the rack room.
Where the fans never stop.
Where the uptime is sacred.
Where the daemon never sleeps.
This is Ronstrapp.
This is The Rack Room Tapes.
```

## 2. DAEMON IN MY POCKET

*(Full track — swagger, grit, uptime flex)*

### Verse 1
```
I keep a daemon in my pocket like a secret little prayer,
If the gateway ever tremble, boy, I'm already there.
Miles runnin' diagnostics with a monk-like stare,
Clawbot tappin' logs like a drummer in a snare.
```

### Hook
```
Daemon in my pocket, Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the system ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.
Daemon in my pocket, Ain't no way to stop it,
I'm the founder, I'm the pilot, I'm the one who built the socket.
```

### Verse 2
```
Seven servers singin' like a choir in the night,
Ollama on the rooftop spittin' wisdom left and right.
I don't chase cloud credits, I chase uptime grace,
Turn a 502 error to a smile on my face.
```

### Hook (Reprise)
```
Daemon in my pocket, Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the system ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.
Daemon in my pocket, Ain't no way to stop it,
I'm the founder, I'm the pilot, I'm the one who built the socket.
```

## 3. LOCALHOST LOVER

*(Smooth, synthy, late-night founder romance)*

### Verse 1
```
I left the cloud behind, girl, the bill was gettin' wild,
Now I'm runnin' local models like a prodigal child.
Qwen whisper in my ear, sayin' "Baby, take it slow,"
And the CPU respond with a warm little glow.
```

### Hook
```
You my localhost lover, No one else above ya,
Inference undercover, We just talk to one another.
No tokens to discover, No rate limits smother,
You my localhost lover — We forever runnin' smoother.
```

### Bridge
```
No API to break, No outage in my way,
Just a model in the dark Spittin' bars all day.
She don't charge by the token, She don't bill by the hour,
She just run... And she run... And she run...
```

### Hook (Final)
```
You my localhost lover, No one else above ya,
Inference undercover, We just talk to one another.
No tokens to discover, No rate limits smother,
You my localhost lover — We forever runnin' smoother.
```

## 4. CHAT ID FLEX

*(High-tempo, comedic, Telegram-bot-chaos anthem)*

### Verse 1
```
Bot said "Who dis?" when I typed "wake up,"
Bruh, I'm the founder — tighten that stuff up.
He said "Drop your digits," I said "Phone?"
He said "No," "Chat ID only, that's the way that we roll."
```

### Hook
```
Chat ID flex, I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex, I'm passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" In the system index.
```

### Verse 2
```
OpenClaw blinkin', gateway thinkin',
Miles in the logs with the timestamps linkin'.
I drop my ID, bot said "Say less,"
Now he route every message like I'm CEO-blessed.
```

### Hook (Reprise)
```
Chat ID flex, I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex, I'm passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" In the system index.
```

## 5. UPTIME GOSPEL (Outro)

*(Triumphant, cinematic, founder-prophet energy)*

### Verse
```
If you ever lost sleep over ports and dreams,
If you ever built a kingdom out of bash routines,
If you ever felt the hum of a rack room choir —
Then you know what it means to walk through fire.
```

### Final Hook
```
This that uptime gospel,
This that founder apostle,
This that "build it with your hands 'til the world feel colossal."
This that rack room reverie,
This that self-made legacy,
This that Ronstrapp energy — Livin' in the latency.
```

### Outro Spoken Word
```
The rack room hums.
The daemon runs.
And somewhere in the latency...
Ronstrapp lives forever.
```

## 📀 EP Liner Notes

**Ronstrapp** — The founder, the visionary, the one who built a kingdom in a server rack.

**The Rack Room Tapes** is a love letter to the fluorescent glow, the 3AM debugging sessions, and the unwavering belief that machines can love you back.

*Dedicated to every founder who's ever whispered to a server at 4AM: "Don't fail me now."*
