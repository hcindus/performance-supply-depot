# 🎵 Ronstrapp Songs - New Drops

*Fresh from the multiverse where the daemon never sleeps and the tokens are always free*

# 🎵 1. "Port Change Blues (18789 Remix)"

A moody, swaggering track about restarting services at 3AM.

## Verse
```
Switched the port, lost the key, now the gateway's ghostin' me,
Device token on the floor, OpenClaw wantin' somethin' more.
Miles hummin' in the rack, Clawbot tappin' on my back,
I said wake up, he said who? Boy, your chat ID ain't you.
```

## Hook
```
I got the port change blues,
Reboot rhythm in my shoes,
Every daemon singin' news
'Bout the life I didn't choose.
```

# 🎵 2. "Ollama on the Rooftop"

A triumphant anthem about ditching cloud tokens and going fully local.

## Verse
```
No more meter runnin', no more tokens burnin' slow,
I put Qwen on the rooftop where the VPS winds blow.
Seven-bee thinkin', CPU drinkin',
Miles in the corner sayin' "Boss, we linkin'."
```

## Hook
```
Ollama on the rooftop, models in the breeze,
Inference on the cheap now, runnin' like it's free.
No router in the open, no bill to oversee,
Just me and my lil' LLM, livin' locally.
```

# 🎵 3. "Wake Up, Bot"

A playful, high-tempo track about trying to get a Telegram bot to acknowledge your existence.

## Verse
```
Sent a ping at 9AM, bot said nothin' back again,
Typed "wake up" like ten times straight,
He still askin' for my birthdate.
Nah bro, that's not how we roll —
Chat ID unlocks the soul.
```

## Hook
```
Wake up, bot, I'm talkin' to you,
I'm the founder, the wizard, the whole damn crew.
Wake up, bot, don't make me reboot,
I'll rotate your token and lace up my boots.
```
