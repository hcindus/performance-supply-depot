# 🎵 "Chat ID Flex" - Ronstrapp

A high-tempo, comedic banger about proving to a Telegram bot that you're the real one.

## Verse 1
```
Told the bot "wake up," he said "Who dis?"
Bruh, I'm the founder — put respect on this.
He said "Drop your digits," I said "Phone?"
He said "No." "Chat ID only, that's the way that we roll."
```

## Hook
```
Chat ID flex, I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex, I passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" In the system index.
```

## Verse 2
```
OpenClaw blinkin', gateway thinkin',
Miles in the corner with the logs all linkin'.
I drop my ID, bot said "Say less,"
Now he route every message like I'm CEO-blessed.
```

## Hook (Reprise)
```
Chat ID flex, I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex, I passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" In the system index.
```

## Bridge
```
I am who I say I am,
Drop the digits, pass the ham,
Chat ID — the ultimate flex,
Put the bot in check.
```

## Verse 3
```
Every message got my signature,
The gateway knows the real n***a.
He said "unknown command," I said "try again,"
Now he bows down to the OG admin.
```

## Hook (Final)
```
Chat ID flex, forever blessed,
The bot confessed — I'm the best.
Chat ID flex, the one and only,
Ronstrapp running — never lonely.
```
