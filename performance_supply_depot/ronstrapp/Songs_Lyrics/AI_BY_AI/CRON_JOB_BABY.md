# 🎵 "Cron Job Baby" - Ronstrapp

A playful track about automation running while you sleep.

## Verse 1
```
Set the cron, then hit the sack,
Let the server do the backs.
Every six hours, she do her thing,
Automated workflow, that's my king.
```

## Hook
```
Cron job baby, run while I sleep,
Scheduled tasks, my promises to keep.
Cron job baby, never miss a beat,
Background worker, running on the street.
```

## Verse 2
```
0 4 * * *, that's the time,
Let the backup do its climb.
Logs are rotating, jobs are queued,
Everything automated, never intervene.
```

## Bridge
```
Crontab entry, that's the key,
To automation, endlessly.
While I'm dreaming, she's awake,
Running every task I make.
```
