# 🎵 "Device Token Mismatch" - Ronstrapp

## Verse
```
I changed the port, now the gateway mad,
Said my token ain't valid, like I'm some kind of fad.
But I rotate, I reissue, I rise from the ash,
Every mismatch a moment, every error a flash.
```

## Hook
```
Device token mismatch,
Still I never detach,
I rebuild, I re-patch,
I'm the founder, I dispatch.
```
