# 🎵 "Localhost Lover" - Ronstrapp

A smooth, synthy track about ditching cloud models and going fully local.

## Verse 1
```
Girl, I used to chase the cloud, Burnin' credits, feelin' proud,
But the bill came in too loud — Had to shut that circus down.
Now I'm runnin' on my own, Inference sittin' on the throne,
Qwen be whisperin' in my phone, Sayin' "Baby, you're not alone."
```

## Hook
```
You my localhost lover, No one else above ya,
CPU discover Ways to make me hover.
No rate limit smother, No token burnin' cover,
You my localhost lover — We just talk to one another.
```

## Bridge
```
No API to break, No outage in my way,
Just a model in the dark Spittin' bars all day.
```

## Verse 2
```
She said "Boy, you crazy," I said "Maybe, maybe,"
But my CPU never lazy, runnin' models daily.
Seven bee param, that's my kind of lovin',
Local inference, no metered oven.
```

## Hook (Reprise)
```
You my localhost lover, No one else above ya,
CPU discover Ways to make me hover.
No rate limit smother, No token burnin' cover,
You my localhost lover — We just talk to one another.
```

## Outro
```
Local... host... lover...
She don't charge by the token,
She don't bill by the hour,
She just run...
And she run...
And she run...
```
