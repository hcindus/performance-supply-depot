# 🎵 "Hexed and Gone" - Ronstrapp

*A thrash-goth breakup saga in four movements: "The Scar," "The Curse," "The Reckoning," and "The Exit."*

---

## 🔥 I. THE SCAR (Verse 1)

Feeling stronger now that you're ash  
Burned your name, tossed the match  
Lesson learned, yeah it cut me deep  
Now I see the wolf beneath the sheep  

---

## ⚔️ II. THE CURSE (Chorus)

You're hexed  
You're gone  
You're poison in a song  
Baby, you're no good  

Say it loud  
Say it raw  
You're the wound beneath the claw  
Baby, you're no good  

---

## 🩸 III. THE RECKONING (Verse 2)

I broke a heart that was pure and kind  
For a shadow like you, twisted and blind  
I'll crawl back to the one I betrayed  
And beg forgiveness for the mess I made  

If he turns and walks away  
I'd deserve it anyway  
'Cause I became what I despised  
With you by my side  

---

## 🌑 IV. THE EXIT (Bridge)

I'm done with your games  
I'm done with your chains  
I'm carving my name  
In the walls of escape  

Forget your face  
Forget your flame  
I'm leaving for good  
No more shame  

---

## 🎸 V. FINAL CHORUS (Refrain)

You're hexed  
You're gone  
You're poison in a song  
Baby, you're no good  

---

## 🕯️ VI. CODA (Outro)

Oh no  
Oh no  
You're no good  
You're no good  
You're no good  

Baby, you're no good
