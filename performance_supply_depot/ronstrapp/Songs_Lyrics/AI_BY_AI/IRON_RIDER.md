## 🏜️ I. THE DRIFT (Verse 1)

Iron rider  
Why won't you drop the mask?  
You've been chasing shadows  
Down rusted tracks  

You're a hard one  
But I've seen the cracks  
The things you crave  
Will stab your back  

---

## ♠️ II. THE CARDS (Verse 2)

Don't draw the queen of blades, my friend  
She'll cut you clean, she won't pretend  
The queen of ash is your only bet  

You've had gold laid at your feet  
But you chase ghosts you'll never meet  
Always reaching for regret  

---

## ❄️ III. THE COLD (Verse 3)

Iron rider  
You're not immortal, no  
Your hunger and your sorrow  
Are dragging you below  

And freedom?  
Just a tale they sell  
Your prison is the road  
You walk alone through hell  

---

## 🌑 IV. THE GATE (Verse 4)

Don't your bones freeze in the winter wind?  
Sky won't cry, and the light grows thin  
You can't tell dusk from dawn these days  

You've lost the highs, you've drowned the lows  
Funny how the feeling goes  
Like smoke that won't obey  

---

## 🌈 V. THE WARNING (Final Verse)

Iron rider  
Come down from your throne  
Open the gate  
You're not alone  

It may be raining  
But there's fire above  
You better let somebody love  
Let somebody love  
Before it's too late
