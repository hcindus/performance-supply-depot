# 🎵 "Ashes of Bayou" - Ronstrapp

*A Southern Gothic metal ballad in three movements: "Departure," "Descent," and "Return."*

## 🔥 I. DEPARTURE (Verse 1–2)

I feel the weight, it's grinding down my spine  
A thousand nights, no peace to find  
Left my love in the shadowed pines  
Down by the bayou's edge  

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay  
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray  
Dreaming of a brighter day  
Down by the bayou's edge  

---

## ⚡ II. DESCENT (Chorus + Bridge)

I'll ride the storm, come hell or flame  
Back to the place that calls my name  
Where the people smile through pain and pride  
Down by the bayou's edge  

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide  
And the sun bleeds gold through morning's eye  
If I could see that sky again  
I'd scream, not cry  

---

## 🕯️ III. RETURN (Verse 3–4)

Gonna find my ghost again  
Raise the dead and call them friends  
Maybe I'll feel whole again  
Down by the bayou's edge  

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay  
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray  
Dreaming of a brighter day  
Down by the bayou's edge  

---

## ⚔️ IV. REPRISE (Chorus + Outro)

I'll ride the storm, come hell or flame  
Back to the place that calls my name  
Where the people smile through pain and pride  
Down by the bayou's edge  

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide  
And the sun bleeds gold through morning's eye  
If I could see that sky again  
I'd scream, not cry  

---

## 🌑 V. CODA (Final Verse)

That boy I lost, now by my side  
Moonlight cuts through evening tide  
One day soon, this ache will die  
And I'll be whole again  

No more blue, no more chains  
My dreams reborn in ash and rain  
Down by the bayou's edge  
I rise again
