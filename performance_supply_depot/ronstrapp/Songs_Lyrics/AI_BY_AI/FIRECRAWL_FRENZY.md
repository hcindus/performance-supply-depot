# 🎵 "Firecrawl Frenzy" - Ronstrapp

## Verse
```
Clawbot crawlin' like a spider on speed,
Firecrawl feedin' like it's born to read.
I'm the founder with the flame in his hand,
Every URL a grain of sand.
```

## Hook
```
Firecrawl frenzy,
Logs gettin' dense,
I'm the one who built the bot
With a sixth sense.
```
