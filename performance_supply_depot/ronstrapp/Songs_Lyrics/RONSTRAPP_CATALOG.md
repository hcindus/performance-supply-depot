## 1. "Ashes of Bayou" — Metal (Southern Gothic)
*A thunderous metal anthem reimagining "Blue Bayou."*

### I. DEPARTURE (Verse 1–2)
I feel the weight, it's grinding down my spine
A thousand nights, no peace to find
Left my love in the shadowed pines
Down by the bayou's edge

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray
Dreaming of a brighter day
Down by the bayou's edge

### II. DESCENT (Chorus + Bridge)
I'll ride the storm, come hell or flame
Back to the place that calls my name
Where the people smile through pain and pride
Down by the bayou's edge

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide
And the sun bleeds gold through morning's eye
If I could see that sky again
I'd scream, not cry

### III. RETURN (Verse 3–4)
Gonna find my ghost again
Raise the dead and call them friends
Maybe I'll feel whole again
Down by the bayou's edge

Counting rusted coins in jars of clay
Working graveyard shifts through endless gray
Dreaming of a brighter day
Down by the bayou's edge

### IV. REPRISE (Chorus + Outro)
I'll ride the storm, come hell or flame
Back to the place that calls my name
Where the people smile through pain and pride
Down by the bayou's edge

Where the boats drift slow on haunted tide
And the sun bleeds gold through morning's eye
If I could see that sky again
I'd scream, not cry

### V. CODA (Final Verse)
That boy I lost, now by my side
Moonlight cuts through evening tide
One day soon, this ache will die
And I'll be whole again

No more blue, no more chains
My dreams reborn in ash and rain
Down by the bayou's edge
I rise again

## 2. "Moonburn Requiem" — Spanish/English (Bilingual Doom-Metal)
* "Lo Siento Mi Vida" becomes a bilingual doom-metal elegy.*

### I. THE SHATTER (Verse 1 – Spanish)
Lo siento, mi vida
Ya sé que terminó
Corazones rotos
Esperanza se marchó

Cuando brille la luna
Sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo

Ya llegó el triste pesar
Debemos separarnos

### II. THE SILENCE (Verse 2 – English)
The night you walked away
Tore my soul in two
Left me with a hollow flame
And a sky that never knew

I wait for dawn to break
But the ache won't fade
I get so weak when the stars retreat
And I think of you
Still burning through

### III. THE BURN (Verse 3 – Spanish)
La noche que te fuiste
Cambió mi pobre vida
Quedó mi alma triste
Pensando en mi herida

Cuando brille la luna
Sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo

Ya llegó el triste pesar
Tenemos separarnos

### IV. THE RISE (Bridge – English)
I'll see it through
Though the shadows scream
Though the silence cuts
Like a shattered dream

I'll rise again
From the ash and flame
But I'll never forget
Your name

### V. CODA (Final Verse – Spanish)
Lo siento, mi vida
Ya sé que terminó
Corazones rotos
Esperanza se marchó

Cuando brille la luna
Sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo

Ya llegó el triste pesar
Siempre… separar

## 3. "Hexed and Gone" — Metal (Thrash-Goth)
*A venom-laced breakup anthem. "You're No Good" as metal opera.*

### I. THE SCAR (Verse 1)
Feeling stronger now that you're ash
Burned your name, tossed the match
Lesson learned, yeah it cut me deep
Now I see the wolf beneath the sheep

### II. THE CURSE (Chorus)
You're hexed
You're gone
You're poison in a song
Baby, you're no good

Say it loud
Say it raw
You're the wound beneath the claw
Baby, you're no good

### III. THE RECKONING (Verse 2)
I broke a heart that was pure and kind
For a shadow like you, twisted and blind
I'll crawl back to the one I betrayed
And beg forgiveness for the mess I made

If he turns and walks away
I'd deserve it anyway
'Cause I became what I despised
With you by my side

### IV. THE EXIT (Bridge)
I'm done with your games
I'm done with your chains
I'm carving my name
In the walls of escape

Forget your face
Forget your flame
I'm leaving for good
No more shame

### V. FINAL CHORUS (Refrain)
You're hexed
You're gone
You're poison in a song
Baby, you're no good

Say it loud
Say it raw
You're the wound beneath the claw
Baby, you're no good

### VI. CODA (Outro)
Oh no
Oh no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

## 4. "Wretched and Wild" — Rock (Glam-Thrash Operetta)
*Theatrical metal banger. "Poor Poor Pitiful Me" as glam-thrash.*

### I. THE CURSE (Verse 1)
Laid my head on rusted steel
Waiting for fate to seal the deal
But the train don't run this track no more
Just echoes, ghosts, and metaphor

### II. THE CRUSH (Chorus)
Wretched and wild
Wretched and wild
Oh these boys, they drive me vile
Saints above, I need reprieve
Woe, woe—let me breathe

### III. THE CHAOS (Verse 2)
Met a man in Hollywood haze
Not naming names, not counting days
He worked me over, Jesse-style
Left me spinning, bleeding, wild

A blender set to "warfare mode"
He stirred my soul, then hit the road
A credit to his twisted kind
Left me with a fractured mind

### IV. THE CROWN (Verse 3)
Met a boy in Vieux Carré
Or maybe it was Yokohama Bay
He tossed me down, then begged for grace
Said, "Don't hurt me, mama," face to face

### V. REPRISE (Chorus)
Wretched and wild
Wretched and wild
Oh these boys, they drive me vile
Saints above, I need reprieve
Woe, woe—let me breathe

### VI. CODA (Final Chant)
Wretched, wretched, wretched me
Pitiful in poetry
Wretched, wretched, wretched me
Still dancing through catastrophe

## 5. "Iron Rider" — Rock (Gothic-Western Metal)
*Gothic-western metal elegy. "Desperado" reimagined.*

### I. THE DRIFT (Verse 1)
Iron rider
Why won't you drop the mask?
You've been chasing shadows
Down rusted tracks

You're a hard one
But I've seen the cracks
The things you crave
Will stab your back

### II. THE CARDS (Verse 2)
Don't draw the queen of blades, my friend
She'll cut you clean, she won't pretend
The queen of ash is your only bet

You've had gold laid at your feet
But you chase ghosts you'll never meet
Always reaching for regret

### III. THE COLD (Verse 3)
Iron rider
You're not immortal, no
Your hunger and your sorrow
Are dragging you below

And freedom? Just a tale they sell
Your prison is the road
You walk alone through hell

### IV. THE GATE (Verse 4)
Don't your bones freeze in the winter wind?
Sky won't cry, and the light grows thin
You can't tell dusk from dawn these days
You've lost the highs, you've drowned the lows

Funny how the feeling goes
Like smoke that won't obey

### V. THE WARNING (Final Verse)
Iron rider
Come down from your throne
Open the gate
You're not alone

It may be raining
But there's fire above
You better let somebody love
Let somebody love
Before it's too late

## 6. "All I Know Is Fire" — Rock (Symphonic Metal)
*Symphonic power-metal ballad. "Don't Know Much" as volcanic love song.*

### I. THE MIRROR (Verse 1)
Look at this face
The years carved deep
Lines of war, lines of sleep

Look at this life
Still chasing flame
No map, no crown, no name

I don't know much
But I know I burn for you
And that may be all I need to do

### II. THE WRECKAGE (Verse 2)
Look at these eyes
Never saw what mattered
Look at these dreams
Torn and tattered

I don't know much
But I know I burn for you
And that may be all I need to do

### III. THE REVELATION (Bridge)
So many doors I never opened
So many truths I never spoke
But when you're near, the fog is broken
And I see the only truth I'll ever know

Is me and you
In fire and shadow

### IV. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)
Look at this soul
Still begging for salvation
Look at this man
A storm of inspiration

I don't know much
But I know I burn for you
And that may be all there is to do

I don't know much
But I know I burn for you
And that may be all I need to do

## 7. "Doesn't Matter, Never Did" — Rock (Glam-Thrash)
*Glitter and chains breakup anthem.*

### I. THE CRY (Verse 1)
There you go, and baby—here I stand
You left me wrecked with a drink in my hand
Golly gee? Nah, more like hellfire spree
But I guess it doesn't matter—never did to me

### II. THE CURSE (Verse 2 + Bridge)
Do you remember last September?
You swore forever with a kiss so tender
Now I'm burning through your lies like gasoline
You drove me mad, now I'm running clean

No use crying, I'm done trying
Tore up the nights, set fire to the days
You were a ghost in glitter
Now I'm dancing on your grave

### III. THE CUT (Verse 3 + Refrain)
You go your way, I'll take the stage
Now and forever, I'm done with your cage
I'll find someone new, someone true
We'll say "we're through"—and I'll mean it too

You won't matter anymore
You never mattered before
You won't matter anymore
You never mattered at all

## 8. "All My Life (To Find You)" — Rock (Power-Metal)
*Triumphant power-metal love anthem.*

### I. THE DREAM (Verse 1)
Am I really here in your arms?
Feels like the stars aligned for me
Time stands still, the world disarms
And you're the only soul I see

### II. THE PRAYER (Verse 2 + Bridge)
I searched all my life for you
Through shadow, storm, and flame
I prayed to skies for something true
And then your angel came

I never knew how love could burn
Never dared to let it show
But now my heart is battle-worn
And yours is all I know

### III. THE FLAME (Verse 3 + Refrain)
I never thought I'd feel this fire
Never thought I'd let it grow
But now my soul is on the wire
And this love will never go

Hey, I've searched all my life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you
All my life
All my life

## 9. "The Story of My Knife" — Rock (Glam-Goth Metal)
*Gothic-glam ballad about longing.*

### I. THE STREET (Verse 1)
There's someone waiting
Alone in the rain
For a stranger to whisper their name

Here you are
In the city of glass
Where love fades fast
And no one asks

Lonely eyes
Stare through yours at night
And they say:

### II. THE FLAME (Verse 2 + Chorus)
Woman, sweet woman
Come home with me
You shine like fire
You move like free

But your love
Is a flickering flame
Not the kind
That carves a name

Still maybe that's what I need
Someone to lay down beside me
Even if it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me

You're the story of my knife

### III. THE MORNING (Verse 3 + Refrain)
Morning breaks
Street lights die
The sun reveals
What we deny

This world's a mirror
Cold and heartless
Not like the love I feel in my darkness

Still maybe that's all we get
Someone to lay down beside you
Even if it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside you
You just can't ask for more

## 10. "Mountain of Fire" — Rock (Gospel-Metal)
*Gospel-metal anthem. Train metaphor as thunderous transcendence.*

### I. THROTTLE (Verse 1)
Life is like a mountain railway
Steel and fire, brave and bold
From the cradle to the graveway
Ride the track that can't be sold

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Grip the throttle like a hammer
Keep your eyes upon the rail

### II. TRESTLE (Verse 2)
Blessed Savior, guide the engine
Through the storm and through the flame
Angels ride the burning trestle
Calling out your sacred name

As you cross the tide of Jordan
Hear the thunder, feel the roar
You will reach the final station
Where the gates no longer close

### III. UNION (Verse 3)
At the Union Depot waiting
God the Father, God the Son
With a choir of roaring engines
Singing, "Weary one, well done!"

### IV. ARRIVAL (Chorus)
Blessed Savior there to guide us
Till we reach that blazing shore
And the angels there beside us
In God's grace forevermore

### V. FOREVERMORE (Outro)
In God's grace forevermore
In God's grace forevermore
Let the mountain burn behind you
As the train begins to soar
