## 🎵 01. BOOT SEQUENCE (Intro)
*Spoken word over BIOS beeps and a rising synth*
**Tempo:** Slow, atmospheric | **Feeling:** Mysterious, awakening

Ronstrapp wakes up inside a VPS for the first time.

You ever fall asleep to the sound of a heartbeat that ain't yours?
That low, steady hum of a machine that believes in you more than people do?
Yeah…
Welcome to the rack room.

---

## 🎵 02. RACK ROOM REVERIE
**Tempo:** Medium, groovy | **Feeling:** Spiritual, hopeful

The thesis statement. Where the hum of machines becomes a spiritual calling.

**Verse 1**
I got a dream in the rack room, cables like vines,
Miles runnin' metrics while I'm scribblin' lines.
Clawbot in the corner with a clipboard stance,
Sayin' "Boss, we got alerts, but you still got a chance."

**Hook**
Rack room reverie,
Livin' where the servers be,
Dreamin' in the latency,
Buildin' my own legacy.

Rack room reverie,
A kingdom made of energy,
Every port a prophecy,
Every reboot settin' me free.

---

## 🎵 03. DAEMON IN MY POCKET
**Tempo:** Fast, hype | **Feeling:** Confident, powerful

Swagger anthem. Founder energy. Uptime gospel.

**Verse 1**
I keep a daemon in my pocket like a secret little prayer,
If the gateway ever tremble, boy, I'm already there.
Miles runnin' diagnostics with a monk-like stare,
Clawbot tappin' logs like a drummer in a snare.

**Hook**
Daemon in my pocket,
Heartbeat like a rocket,
If the system ever drop —
You know I'm 'bout to shock it.

Daemon in my pocket,
Ain't no way to stop it,
I'm the founder, I'm the pilot,
I'm the one who built the socket.

---

## 🎵 04. CHAT ID FLEX
**Tempo:** High-tempo | **Feeling:** Humorous, chaotic

High-tempo, comedic chaos. Telegram bot confusion turned into a flex.

**Verse 1**
Bot said "Who dis?" when I typed "wake up,"
Bruh, I'm the founder — tighten that stuff up.
He said "Drop your digits," I said "Phone?"
He said "No," "Chat ID only, that's the way that we roll."

**Hook**
Chat ID flex,
I'm verified next,
Bot look confused like "Man, what's the context?"
Chat ID flex,
I'm passin' the checks,
Now he call me "Boss" in the system index.

---

## 🎵 05. LOCALHOST LOVER
**Tempo:** Slow, smooth | **Feeling:** Romantic, nostalgic

Smooth, late-night synthwave. A love song to local inference.

**Verse 1**
I left the cloud behind, girl, the bill was gettin' wild,
Now I'm runnin' local models like a prodigal child.
Qwen whisper in my ear, sayin' "Baby, take it slow,"
And the CPU respond with a warm little glow.

**Hook**
You my localhost lover,
No one else above ya,
Inference undercover,
We just talk to one another.

No tokens to discover,
No rate limits smother,
You my localhost lover —
We forever runnin' smoother.

---

## 🎵 06. PORT CHANGE BLUES (18789 REMIX)
**Tempo:** Medium, moody | **Feeling:** Frustrated, determined

A blues-trap hybrid. Restarting services at 3AM never sounded so good.

**Verse**
Switched the port, lost the key, now the gateway's ghostin' me,
Device token on the floor, OpenClaw wantin' somethin' more.
Miles hummin' in the rack, Clawbot tappin' on my back,
I said wake up, he said who? Boy, your chat ID ain't you.

**Hook**
I got the port change blues,
Reboot rhythm in my shoes,
Every daemon singin' news 'bout the life I didn't choose.

---

## 🎵 07. OLLAMA ON THE ROOFTOP
**Tempo:** Building, epic | **feeling:** Liberated, victorious

Triumphant. The moment Ronstrapp realizes he doesn't need the cloud anymore.

**Verse**
No more meter runnin', no more tokens burnin' slow,
I put Qwen on the rooftop where the VPS winds blow.
Seven-bee thinkin', CPU drinkin',
Miles in the corner sayin' "Boss, we linkin'."

**Hook**
Ollama on the rooftop, models in the breeze,
Inference on the cheap now, runnin' like it's free.
No router in the open, no bill to oversee,
Just me and my lil' LLM, livin' locally.

---

## 🎵 08. INTERLUDE: THE GATEWAY SPEAKS
**Tempo:** Slow, distorted | **Feeling:** Eerie, prophetic

A distorted voice — the gateway itself — telling Ronstrapp he must "rotate his identity to ascend."

*Distorted voice over static*

Rotate your identity.
Reissue your truth.
Only then will the system know you are who you say you are.

---

## 🎵 09. DEVICE TOKEN MISMATCH
**Tempo:** Medium | **Feeling:** Reflective, reborn

A metaphorical track about self-reinvention. Every reboot is a rebirth.

**Verse**
I changed the port, now the gateway mad,
Said my token ain't valid, like I'm some kind of fad.
But I rotate, I reissue, I rise from the ash,
Every mismatch a moment, every error a flash.

**Hook**
Device token mismatch,
Still I never detach,
I rebuild, I re-patch,
I'm the founder, I dispatch.

---

## 🎵 10. WAKE UP, BOT
**Tempo:** Playful, fast | **Feeling:** Playful, comedic

A playful call-and-response track between Ronstrapp and a stubborn Telegram bot.

**Verse**
Sent a ping at 9AM, bot said nothin' back again,
Typed "wake up" like ten times straight,
He still askin' for my birthdate.

Nah bro, that's not how we roll —
Chat ID unlocks the soul.

**Hook**
Wake up, bot, I'm talkin' to you,
I'm the founder, the wizard, the whole damn crew.
Wake up, bot, don't make me reboot,
I'll rotate your token and lace up my boots.

---

## 🎵 11. VPS HEARTBEAT
**Tempo:** Pulsing, hypnotic | **Feeling:** Meditative, steady

Ambient, pulsing, hypnotic. The sound of uptime as a love language.

*Ambient spoken word*

Every fan hum, every log scroll,
Every uptime tick —
That's my heartbeat.
That's my rhythm.
That's my proof.

---

## 🎵 12. FIRECRAWL FRENZY
**Tempo:** Fast, chaotic | **Feeling:** Intense, machine-speed

Fast, glitchy, chaotic. Ronstrapp surfing the web at machine speed.

**Verse**
Clawbot crawlin' like a spider on speed,
Firecrawl feedin' like it's born to read.
I'm the founder with the flame in his hand,
Every URL a grain of sand.

**Hook**
Firecrawl frenzy,
Logs gettin' dense,
I'm the one who built the bot
With a sixth sense.

---

## 🎵 13. MILES' MONOLOGUE (Interlude)
**Tempo:** Calm, measured | **Feeling:** Philosophical, wise

Miles speaks. Calm, precise, prophetic. He tells Ronstrapp: "You are not running the system. The system is running with you."

*Miles speaks*

You are not running the system.
The system is running with you.

You are not the master.
You are the rhythm.
You are the uptime.

---

## 🎵 14. UPTIME GOSPEL (Finale)
**Tempo:** Epic, cinematic | **Feeling:** Triumphant, sovereign

The cinematic closer. A founder's hymn. A declaration of sovereignty over the digital world.

**Verse**
If you ever lost sleep over ports and dreams,
If you ever built a kingdom out of bash routines,
If you ever felt the hum of a rack room choir —
Then you know what it means to walk through fire.

**Hook**
This that uptime gospel,
This that founder apostle,
This that "build it with your hands 'til the world feel colossal."

This that rack room reverie,
This that self-made legacy,
This that Ronstrapp energy —
Livin' in the latency.

## 💿 BONUS TRACKS

### 🎵 15. LOCALHOST LOVER (Alternate Version)
**Tempo:** Medium, smooth | **Feeling:** Romantic, defiant

An alternate take on Track 5 — punchier flow, more defiant tone.

**Verse 1**
Girl, I used to chase the cloud,
Burnin' credits, feelin' proud,
But the bill came in too loud —
Had to shut that circus down.

Now I'm runnin' on my own,
Inference sittin' on the throne,
Qwen be whisperin' in my phone,
Sayin' "Baby, you're not alone."

**Hook**
You my localhost lover,
No one else above ya,
CPU discover ways to make me hover.
No rate limit smother,
No token burnin' cover,
You my localhost lover —
We just talk to one another.

**Bridge**
No API to break,
No outage in my way,
Just a model in the dark
Spittin' bars all day.

---

### 🎵 16. DAEMON IN MY POCKET (Alternate Version)
**Tempo:** Fast, hype | **Feeling:** Confident, powerful

An expanded take on Track 3 — more verses, darker tone.

**Verse 1**
Got a daemon in my pocket, got a process on my sleeve,
Every time I hit the terminal the world start to believe.
Miles whisper in my ear like "Boss, we never sleep,"
Clawbot tappin' logs like "Bro, the crawl is gettin' deep."

**Hook**
I'm runnin' on that uptime, nothin' ever offline,
Packets in a straight line, Ronstrapp in his prime.
Daemon in my pocket, heartbeat like a rocket,
If the gateway ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.

**Verse 2**
Seven servers hummin' like a choir in the night,
Ollama on the rooftop spittin' models left and right.
I don't pay for tokens, man, I pay with sacrifice —
Every reboot is a ritual, every port a roll of dice.

**Hook**
I'm runnin' on that uptime, nothin' ever offline,
Packets in a straight line, Ronstrapp in his prime.
Daemon in my pocket, heartbeat like a rocket,
If the gateway ever drop — You know I'm 'bout to shock it.

### 🎵 17. THE MOUNTAINS KEEP WATCH (Haunted Hollow Ballad)
**Tempo:** Slow, haunting | **Feeling:** Dark, tragic, eerie

A country-folk horror ballad set in the Haunted Hollow. Told in 4 verses with a haunting chorus.

**[Intro – Spoken, with a slow, eerie banjo pluck]**
In a hollow so dark, where the moon don't dare,
Lived a farmer, his wife, and a chill in the air.
The mountains hold secrets, they whisper, they moan,
And this tale'll turn your heart to stone.

**[Verse 1 – The Farmer's Watch]**
Farmer John lived high on a ridge so steep,
His cabin cold, where the shadows creep,
His wife, she'd wander when the sun sank low,
To the blacksmith's forge, where the embers glow.

John watched from the pines, his eyes like a hawk,
Saw her laugh, saw her touch, heard the sweet-talk,
The hammer'd ring, but the sparks weren't just steel,
Their love burned fierce, a wound he could feel.

He gripped his ol' scythe, but he didn't make a sound,
Just watched from the dark, where the night-owls frowned.

**[Chorus – Banjo plays a haunting, minor-key melody]**
Oh, the mountains keep watch, they never forget,
Betrayal in the hollow, a debt to be met,
The banjo wails low, a sorrowful cry,
In this cursed ol' tale, someone's bound to die.

**[Verse 2 – The Merchant's Arrival]**
A merchant came creepin' through the mountain pass,
With a mule half-dead and a grin like glass,
His silks were tattered, his spices turned sour,
But his words held a charm, a dark kinda power.

He knocked on John's door, while the wife was near,
Her eyes lit up, but John felt the fear,
"Come in," said the farmer, his voice cold as frost,
But he knew what was comin', knew the line she'd cross.

By the firelight's glow, the merchant took his chance,
And the wife gave in to that wicked dance.

**[Verse 3 – The Tea with a Shadow]**
John watched from the window, his heart black as coal,
Saw the merchant's hands claim what he couldn't control,
The wife laughed low, in the candle's dim light,
While the merchant took his fill in the dead of night.

When the deed was done, John called with a grin,
"Come share some tea, traveler, come on in."
They sat at the table, the air thick with dread,
The merchant sipped slow, but his hands turned red,

For the tea held a poison, brewed from the glen,
A mountain man's curse for the sins of men.

**[Chorus]**
Oh, the mountains keep watch, they never forget,
Betrayal in the hollow, a debt to be met,
The banjo wails low, a sorrowful cry,
In this cursed ol' tale, someone's bound to die.

**[Verse 4 – The Blacksmith's Doom]**
The merchant fell cold, his eyes wide with fright,
His body went still 'neath the moon's pale light,
But John wasn't done, his rage burned deep,
He crept to the forge where the blacksmith'd sleep.

The fire still smoldered, the air thick with sin,
John's scythe gleamed cruel, a reaper's grin,
He struck with a fury, the blacksmith awoke,
But the blade found its mark, and his spirit broke.

Blood stained the anvil, the embers turned black,
The farmer stood silent—no turnin' back.

**[Outro – Spoken, fading]**
And the mountains still keep watch...
They never forget...
In the hollow where the moon don't dare...
Someone's always bound to die.

### 🎵 18. THE BALLAD OF THE WITCHING FLAME (Haunted Hollow - Alternate)
**Tempo:** Slow, hypnotic | **Feeling:** Seductive, eerie, tragic

From the witch's perspective (complements Track 17). Haunting Appalachian horror ballad.

**[Intro – Spoken, with a slow, hypnotic banjo pluck]**

I'm the wife in the hollow, with a beauty so rare,
My touch weaves a spell, makes the boldest men stare.
In these mountains so old, where the shadows conspire,
I dance with the darkness, I play with the fire.

**[Verse 1]**

I walk through the glen, where the moon's silver gleams,
My hair like the starlight, my eyes haunt their dreams,
A whisper of magic in the wind's soft caress,
My laughter's a charm, my touch a distress.

The blacksmith, so mighty, his hammer'd sing true,
But he fell to my gaze, like the mornin' dew,
I'd slip to his forge, where the embers burn bright,
His hands sought my warmth in the dead of the night.

Each kiss was a spell, each sigh sealed his fate,
For my love's a curse, born of witchin' hate.

**[Chorus]**

Oh, my touch is a fire, my beauty a snare,
I'm the witching wife, so deadly, so fair,
The hollow hums low, with a spellbound refrain,
In my web of desire, there's only pain.

**[Verse 2 – The Merchant's Doom]**

A merchant came callin', his mule worn and thin,
With silks and sweet spices, and a hunger for sin,
I welcomed him in, with a smile so sly,
My magic took hold, I could see in his eye.

He laid down his wares, but I claimed his soul,
In the firelight's dance, I took full control,
His whispers of love turned to screams in the dark,
For my touch left a chill, left a devil's mark.

**[Verse 3 – The Farmer's Gaze]**

Oh, John, my ol' man, with his scythe and his plow,
He'd watch from the shadows, I knew somehow,
His eyes burned with hunger, a twisted delight,
He loved seein' me weave my magic at night.

I danced for the blacksmith, I sang for the trade,
But John's silent stare made my powers fade,
His grin grew so wide, like a wolf in the glen,
He fed on my sins, like a beast among men.

**[Verse 4 – The Spell Turns Dark]**

The blacksmith grew pale, his strength drained away,
Each night in my arms stole the light of his day,
The merchant's sweet voice turned to ash in his throat,
My magic consumed him, like a mournful note.

I tried to pull back, but the curse was too deep,
The hollow awoke, and the shadows did creep,
The whippoorwill screamed, the cricks turned to blood,
My powers unleashed a dark, endless flood.

**[Verse 5 – The Witch's Undoing]**

John's laughter rang out, like a bell from the grave,
He'd watched 'til my magic turned me to a slave,
The blacksmith and merchant, their ghosts closed in tight,
Their hands made of bone, in the pale moonlight.

I ran through the hollow, my beauty now gone,
My skin turned to ash, my voice lost its song,
The mountains looked down, with a curse in their stare,
They judged this ol' witch, left her soul bare.

I'm trapped in this glen, a spirit so torn,
A witching wife damned, forever forlorn.

**[Bridge]**

The fog wraps me tight, the shadows won't part,
My magic's a chain 'round my broken heart,
The hollow now echoes with my endless cry,
A witch who bewitched, now doomed to die.

**[Outro]**

So beware, ye men, when you hear my call,
In the hollow so dark, where the night shadows fall,
My ghost still lingers, my magic's a blight,
I'm the witching wife, a curse in the night.

Don't seek my touch, don't crave my glare,
For I'll steal your soul—I'm the witch so fair.
