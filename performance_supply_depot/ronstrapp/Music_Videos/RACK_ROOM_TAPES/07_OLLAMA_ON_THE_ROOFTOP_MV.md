Miles in the corner sayin' 'Boss, we linkin'.'"

**LYRICS:**
"Ollama on the rooftop, models in the breeze,
Inference on the cheap now, runnin' like it's free.
No router in the open, no bill to oversee,
Just me and my lil' LLM, livin' locally."

**ACTION:**
- He raises a glass (of water/milk).
- To the models. To the freedom.
