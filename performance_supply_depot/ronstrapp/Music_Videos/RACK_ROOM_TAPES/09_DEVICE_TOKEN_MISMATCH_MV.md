## TREATMENT

### SCENE 1: THE MISMATCH (0:00-1:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Server screens show "TOKEN MISMATCH" errors everywhere.
- Ronstrapp's figure flickers — glitch effect.

**LYRICS:**
"I changed the port, now the gateway mad,
Said my token ain't valid, like I'm some kind of fad."

**ACTION:**
- He looks at his hands — they're pixelating.
- Panic.

---

### SCENE 2: THE TRANSFORMATION (1:00-2:00)

**VISUAL:**
- He undergoes "identity rotation" — glitching through versions of himself.
- Each version slightly different.

**LYRICS:**
"But I rotate, I reissue, I rise from the ash,
Every mismatch a moment, every error a flash."

**ACTION:**
- He transforms: different clothes, different looks.
- Each time: stronger.

### SCENE 3: THE CHORUS (2:00-3:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Final form: Ronstrapp fully realized, glowing.
- The system accepts him.

**LYRICS:**
"Device token mismatch,
Still I never detach,
I rebuild, I re-patch,
I'm the founder, I dispatch."

**ACTION:**
- He walks through the system, accepted.
- All errors resolve to green.

### SCENE 4: CODA (3:00-3:30)

**VISUAL:**
- He stands in the server room, whole.
- Looks at his hands — solid.

**ACTION:**
- Nods. Ready.
- Fade.
