"Feeling stronger now that you're ash / Burned your name, tossed the match..."

**ACTION:**
- Inside: A woman (Ronstrapp frontwoman) stands before a CAULDRON.
- She throws in ingredients: photos, letters, a teddy bear.
- Green flame erupts.

### SCENE 2: THE RITUAL (0:30-1:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Forest clearing. A PYRE stands ready.
- She carries a basket of items to the pyre.

"Lesson learned, yeah it cut me deep / Now I see the wolf beneath the sheep..."

**ACTION:**

### SCENE 3: THE BURNING (1:00-1:30)

**VISUAL:**
- The pyre BLOSSOMS with green and black flames.
- Smoke rises to the sky.
- She watches, arms crossed. No emotion.

**LYRICS:**
"You're hexed / You're gone / You're poison in a song / Baby, you're no good..."

**ACTION:**
- Close-up: Her eyes reflecting fire.
- Wide: The forest lit by the pyre's glow.
- She doesn't flinch. She's done feeling.

### SCENE 4: THE GHOST (1:30-2:00)

**VISUAL:**
- In the flames: A FIGURE appears. Her ex.
- Waving, trying to speak.
- She watches, unimpressed.

**LYRICS:**
"I broke a heart that was pure and kind / For a shadow like you, twisted and blind..."

**ACTION:**
- She raises her hand.
- The figure SCREAMS silently.
- Dissolves into ash.

### SCENE 5: THE BREAKDOWN (2:00-2:30)

**VISUAL:**
- The pyre dies. Ash on the ground.
- She kneels. For the first time: emotion.
- Tears? No. Just... emptiness.

**LYRICS:**
"I'll crawl back to the one I betrayed / And beg forgiveness for the mess I made..."

**ACTION:**
- She touches the ash.
- Stands.
- Walks away from the pyre.

### SCENE 6: THE TRANSFORMATION (2:30-3:15)

**VISUAL:**
- She enters the cottage. Mirror on the wall.
- Her reflection changes: BLACK WINGS emerge.
- She becomes something MORE.

**LYRICS:**
"I'm done with your games / I'm done with your chains / I'm carving my name / In the walls of escape..."

**ACTION:**
- She spreads her wings.
- The mirror CRACKS.
- She smiles — a dark, knowing smile.

### SCENE 7: CODA (3:15-3:48)

**VISUAL:**

- Behind her: Nothing. The pyre is gone. The cottage is gone.
