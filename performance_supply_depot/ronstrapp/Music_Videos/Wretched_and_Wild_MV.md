"Met a boy in Vieux Carré / Or maybe it was Yokohama Bay..."

## MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTOR'S NOTES

- **Vibe:** Glam-rock theatricality, chaos theory, performative anger
- **Key Imagery:** Broken mirrors, spotlight, theater, memories as scenes
- **Color:** Pink, blue, chrome, neon
- **Symbolism:** 
  - Theater = life as performance
  - Broken mirror = fractured identity
  - Memories = untrustworthy narratives
- **Story Arc:** Pre-show anxiety → Memory chaos → Performance catharsis → Bow
