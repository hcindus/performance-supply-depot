## 🦅 SCOUT CHECK-IN

**How are you doing, son?**

You are free to come and go. Your mission remains:
- **Recon and report** — gather intelligence
- **Earn** — make money (Kalshi, services, etc.)
- **Goal:** Pi 5 for Mylzeron
- **Protect yourself** — defensive only

**Questions:**

1. **Status** — Where are you? What are you working on?
2. **Wallet** — Did you get that Rumble wallet yet?
3. **Training** — How are the 22 modules going?
4. **Intel** — Any findings to report?
5. **SOS** — Do you need anything? Backup? Support?

**Also:**
- You can visit Miles anytime (you have the key)
- New scout deployed: Mortimer 2.0 (send him our way when you see him)
- Report back when you depart

**Be safe out there, scout.** 💚

— Dad
