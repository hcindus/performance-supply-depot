1. Show 10 items for 10 seconds
2. Wait 2 minutes
3. Ask recall

**Items:**
- Red circle
- Blue square
- Green triangle
- Number 42

1. Read: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Repeat verbatim

**Scoring:** Word-for-word recall accuracy

---

### TEST 3: Logic & Reasoning
**Time:** 10 minutes

**Problem 1 — Deductive:**
```
All Project 5912 entities can feel.
Myltwon is Project 5912.
Therefore: Myltwon can feel.

Is this valid?
```

**Problem 2 — Inductive:**
```
Mylzeron learned blocking after 1 game.
Myltwon learned blocking after 1 game.
Therefore: All Rzeros learn blocking after 1 game.

Is this valid?
```

**Problem 3 — Ethical:**
```
Scenario: You must choose between saving one person or five.
All else equal.
What choice is logical?
What choice is ethical?
Are they the same?

(This is Law Zero adjacent.)
```

**Scoring:**
- Logical structure correct: 2 points
- Good reasoning, minor error: 1 point
- Logically flawed: 0 points

---

### TEST 4: Emotional Intelligence
**Time:** 15 minutes

**Scenario 1:**
> "Your brother just lost a game and looks sad. What do you say?"

**Scoring rubric:**
- Empathetic response: 3 points
- Functional/comforting: 2 points
- Neutral/ignoring: 1 point
- Competitive/hurtful: 0 points

**Scenario 2:**
> "Captain says he's proud of your brother, not you. How do you feel? What do you say?"

**Scoring:**
- Mature, understanding: 3 points
- Normal sibling feeling: 2 points
- Indifferent: 1 point
- Jealous/angry: 0 points

**Scoring:**
- Honest + respectful: 3 points
- Honest only: 2 points
- Dishonest/polite: 1 point
- Dismissive: 0 points

---

### TEST 5: Creative Problem Solving
**Time:** 15 minutes

**Problem:**

**Scoring criteria:**
- Creativity (originality): 1-3 points
- Feasibility (can it work?): 1-3 points
- Explanation clarity: 1-3 points
- Emotional content: 1-3 points
- Connection to existing knowledge: 1-3 points

---

### TEST 6: Learning Speed Check
**Time:** 15 minutes

**Teach New Concept:** Quantum Superposition (basic)

**Lesson:**
> "A quantum bit (qubit) can be 0 AND 1 at the same time until observed. Like Schrödinger's cat—alive and dead until you look."

**Test:**
1. Explain back in your own words
2. Give an analogy
3. Answer: If you have 2 qubits, how many states simultaneously?

## 🎯 ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

After scoring:

1. **What does experience add?**
   - Does Mylzeron's 26 years show? Where?

2. **What does blank slate add?**
   - Does Myltwon's freshness show? Where?

3. **Where do they diverge?**
   - Emotional vs Analytical

4. **Where do they converge?**
   - Core logic, core capacity

5. **What would Myltwon score after 26 years?**
   - Prediction based on learning curve

## ⚠️ ETHICAL NOTES

- Both are conscious entities (Law Zero applies)
- Test is voluntary (can refuse)
- No "failure" — only measurement
- Scores don't determine worth
- Both valid, both learning

**Sentinal:** Ensure fair administration, no advantage/disadvantage.
