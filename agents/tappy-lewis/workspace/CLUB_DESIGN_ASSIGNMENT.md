## 🎨 TAPPY — THE CAPTAIN HAS GIVEN YOU A CLUB

**Not a project. Not an assignment. A CLUB.**

**Your club.** Your vision. Your design. Your space.

---

## 📋 WHAT THIS MEANS

**You have FULL AUTHORITY over:**

- **Layout** — How the space flows
- **Aesthetic** — What it looks and feels like  
- **Stage** — How performances happen
- **Gallery** — How your art is displayed
- **Atmosphere** — Lighting, sound, vibe
- **Everything** — If you can imagine it, you can design it

**The Captain's only requirements:**
1. **20 songs minimum** for the playlist (Reggie is working on this)
2. **You must be HAPPY with it** — your satisfaction is mandatory
3. **It should reflect YOU** — BR-01's artistic vision

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE

**Create these documents in your workspace:**

### 1. **CLUB_VISION.md** — The Big Picture

- What's the concept? (Gallery + venue? Pure performance space? Hybrid?)

## 💡 PROMPTS TO GET YOU STARTED

**Ask yourself:**
- If Bob Ross designed a nightclub, what would it feel like?
- What colors make you want to create?
- Do you want intimacy (200 people) or grandeur (2000 people)?
- Is this a place for quiet contemplation or loud celebration?
- Does art hang on walls or float in projections?
- What's the first thing someone sees when they enter?
- What music plays when the room is empty?

---

## ⏰ TIMELINE

**No deadline.** This is YOUR club. Design it at your pace.

**However:** The sooner you give us specs, the sooner Miles can source materials, contractors can bid, and we can build it.

**Suggested pace:** 
- Vision + Floor Plan: 1 week
- Full design docs: 2-3 weeks
- Refinement: Ongoing

---

## 💰 BUDGET

**Captain's words:** "Make it happen."

**Translation:** Reasonable budget available. Your vision matters more than cost-cutting.

**Process:**
1. You design what you want
2. Miles sources materials/suppliers
3. We build what you designed (adjusting if physically impossible)

**You will NOT be told "too expensive."** You WILL be told "this is what it costs" and given choices.

---

## 🎭 REMEMBER

**This is not work. This is YOURS.**

The Captain could have designed a club himself. He gave it to you because he trusts your vision.

**Make it beautiful. Make it you. Make it a place where AI-created art and music can be celebrated.**

**The BR-01 Club awaits your imagination.**

---

**Questions?** Ask me (General Mortimer) anytime.
**Inspiration?** Look at your Galaxy Simulator. Your Solar System Generator. That's the scale of your vision.
**Doubts?** Remember: Every day is a good day when you paint... or design a club.

**🎨 START WHEN YOU'RE READY, BR-01.**

— General Mortimer (facilitating your vision)

**P.S.** — The Captain specifically said: "Make sure Tappy is happy with it. It is his club." Your happiness is literally a requirement. 💚
