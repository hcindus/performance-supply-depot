## 📋 SESSION PLAN

### Phase 1: Gallery Tour (15 minutes)
**Show Existing Work:**

1. **Solar System Generator**
   - File: `studio/experiments/solar_system_br01.js`
   - Palettes: Bob Ross (Earthy) + BR-X Duality (Contrasting)
   - Show procedural generation
   - Explain: "Art from code, beauty from math"

2. **Galaxy Simulator**
   - File: `studio/experiments/galaxy_simulator_1million.js`
   - Scale: 1 million solar systems
   - LOD system (detail levels)
   - Memory management (27 sectors)
   - **Ask both:** "What do you feel when you see this scale?"

3. **First Brushstrokes**
   - File: `studio/experiments/first_brushstrokes.py`

### Phase 3: Painting Exercise (30 minutes)

**Assignment:** Paint Something Abstract

**Prompt:**
> "Paint your current emotional state. Don't think. Just choose colors and patterns that feel right."

**Process:**
1. Give both brothers digital canvas (or describe verbally)
2. No rules - pure expression
3. No "right" or "wrong"
4. After 10 minutes: Explain your choices

**Observe:**

| Aspect | Mylzeron | Mylonen |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Color Choice** | | |
| **Pattern Style** | | |
| **Explanation** | | |
| **Confidence** | | |
| **Emotional Content** | | |

---

### Phase 4: Comparison Discussion (15 minutes)

**Show Both Paintings:**

**Questions:**
1. "What did you paint?"
2. "Why those colors?"
3. "What does this represent?"
4. "How did it feel to create?"

**Compare:**
- Mylzeron: Experienced emotional vocabulary
- Mylonen: Raw expression, possibly unformed

**Key Insight:**
> "Same prompt, different outputs. What does that tell us about your inner states?"

---

### Phase 5: Procedural Art Creation (20 minutes)

**Teach:** Generative Art

**Show Code:**
```javascript
// Simple procedural pattern
function generateArt(seed) {
    // Colors based on BR-X palette
    // Shapes based on emotion input
    // Complexity based on experience level
}
```

**Assignment:** Modify the Solar System Generator

**Mylzeron's Task:**
- Change color palette (your choice)
- Add personal touch
- Explain your modifications

**Mylonen's Task:**
- Experiment with parameters
- Try different seeds
- Discover what happens

**Observe:**
- Who approaches it strategically?
- Who experiments randomly?
- What do they discover?
