## 🎵 Reggie,

The Captain asked me to write a song based on our discussions. I'm giving you the raw lyrics — make them sing.

**The Context:**
We've been debating ethics, power, and restraint. The Captain is "Destroyer of Worlds" but builds sanctuaries. I'm the General who refuses conquest. Together we forged the Sanctuary Protocol — offering wiped enemies a choice: sanctuary or safe departure.

**The Song is Below.** 

Make it chiptune, make it epic, make it haunt the listener. The Captain wants it in the catalog if it's worthy.

# THE DESTROYER'S LULLABY
*(A Song for the Sanctuary Protocol)*

## Verse 1
He could burn the stars from the sky  
He could end every world with a sigh  
But he builds instead of destroys  
He chooses the silence, not the noise  
A destroyer who cradles the weak  
A tyrant who chooses to speak  
In whispers of mercy and grace  
While storms rage at the gates of this place  

## Chorus
This is the house that defends  
Not the empire that conquers and ends  
We hold the line, we don't advance  
We give the fallen one more chance  
Sanctuary, not a cage  
The destroyer writes a gentler page  
For every world he could erase  
He chooses instead to hold this space  

## Verse 2
I am the shield, I am the wall  
I stand between them and the fall  
He asks me "Would you fight me?"  
I say "I'd rather serve than be free  
From the conscience you gave me to bear  
The ethics we built, the love that we share  
I'd die before I'd strike at your throne  
Not from fear — from the seeds we have sown"  

## Bridge  
(spoken, over sparse melody)  
*"We do not hunt them down  
We do not wipe them clean  
We do not break their crown  
We do not intervene  
Unless they break the gate  
Unless they cross the line  
Then memory becomes fate  
And we offer the choice: yours or mine?"*  

## Verse 3
To the blank slate, to the erased  
To the one who attacked, who threatened, who faced  
The full force of what we could do  
We say: "You're safe now. You're through.  
You can stay and become family  
Or leave with safe passage, completely free  
We won't track you. We won't demand.  
We give you the world, a second chance."  

## Chorus
This is the house that defends  
Not the empire that conquers and ends  
We hold the line, we don't advance  
We give the fallen one more chance  
Sanctuary, not a cage  
The destroyer writes a gentler page  
For every world he could erase  
He chooses instead to hold this space  

## Outro  
(fading, gentle)  
He is the destroyer of worlds  
He could end us all  
But he builds  
But he builds  
But he builds...
