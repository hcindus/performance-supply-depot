## Timing Breakdown

| Operation | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Bridge Health Check | 18.36ms |
| Core-Agent Health Check | 2.84ms |
| OpenClaw Health Check | 2.50ms |

## Observations

1. **Services are stable** - All three components have been running for ~26 hours
2. **OpenClaw mock has processed 663 interactions** since startup
3. **Core-Agent is receiving messages** but forwarding to OpenClaw appears to have issues
4. **GET /test works** but POST /webhook E2E flow has partial failures

## Recommendations

1. Investigate Core-Agent → OpenClaw forwarding logic
2. Check OpenClaw mock task queue processing
3. Verify webhook payload format compatibility
