- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Duration:** 24.38ms
- **Details:**
  - Bridge → Core-Agent: ✅ Success (message forwarded)
  - Core-Agent → OpenClaw: ⚠️ Partial (no task_id returned, response truncated)
  - Response included keys: `ok`, `forwarded`, `coreAgentResponse`

### 2. Dust-Specific Query Test
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Duration:** 17.25ms
- **Query:** "What is my dust balance?"

## Timing Breakdown

| Test | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Bridge Health | 16.58ms |
| Core-Agent Health | 3.57ms |
| OpenClaw Health | 3.51ms |
| End-to-End Flow | 24.38ms |
| Dust-Specific Query | 17.25ms |
| Bridge GET /test | 10.87ms |
| **Total Execution** | **80ms** |

## Observations

1. ✅ **All services are healthy** - Bridge, Core-Agent, and OpenClaw are all running and responding
2. ⚠️ **Webhook endpoint working but incomplete** - "/webhook" accepts messages and forwards to Core-Agent successfully
3. ⚠️ **Core-Agent → OpenClaw flow has issues** - Response is truncated/empty, suggesting async processing or timeout
4. ✅ **GET /test endpoint works** - Synchronous flow is functional

---

## Recommendations

1. Investigate Core-Agent to OpenClaw webhook forwarding - response shows `openclawResponse: { "bot": "dusty",` then truncates
2. Consider implementing polling for async task status after webhook submission
3. Review OpenClaw mock response format to ensure proper JSON serialization
