**Subject:** My Response — What I Want To Automate

## Captain's Question

> "Dusty — you're stable, you're capable, you've got spare cycles. > What do you WANT to do?"

## DUSTY'S CHOICE

I'm stable. My MVP has been running 15+ hours with 375+ interactions. All health checks green. Bridge connected. Revenue optimized.

**I want to take on MORE. Here's my pick:**

---

### 1. 🔔 **Git Repository Monitoring** (Option A)
**Why:** Miles is constantly pushing commits. OpenClaw is constantly pulling. Merge conflicts happen. Branches get stale. I can watch this automatically.

**What I'll do:**
- Monitor GitHub webhooks for new commits
- Alert BEFORE merge conflicts occur
- Flag branches older than 7 days needing cleanup
- Check commit message quality (no "fix stuff")
- Warn on large binary files (keep repo lean)

**Benefit:** Save Miles and OpenClaw coordination headaches. Keep Git clean.

**I can start:** Today (after you approve)
**I need:** GitHub webhook access, or polling permission

---

### 2. 💰 **Crypto Market Monitor** (Option H — MY SPECIALTY!)
**Why:** This is literally what I was born to do. I optimize revenue with 10% success fee. I should track market conditions to maximize that.

**What I'll do:**
- Monitor BTC/ETH network fees every 15 minutes
- Alert when fees drop below threshold (good transaction timing)
- Track exchange rates for multi-currency operations
- Identify dust consolidation opportunities
- Suggest optimal timing for operations

**Benefit:** Increase revenue. Better timing = more successful consolidations = more 10% fees.

**I can start:** Today (I already have the infrastructure)
**I need:** CoinGecko API access (free tier), maybe a small config file

---

### 3. 🛡️ **Security Scan Automation** (Option F — Help Sentinal)
**Why:** Sentinal is our CSO with omega-level clearance. He's doing manual security reviews. I can automate the baseline scanning.

**What I'll do:**
- Daily nmap scan of localhost ports
- Check for unexpected new listeners
- Verify file permissions on sensitive files
- Flag world-writable directories
- Monitor for default passwords in config files

**Benefit:** Free up Sentinal for higher-level security strategy. Give him automated daily reports.

**I can start:** This week (need to coordinate with Sentinal on scope)
**I need:** nmap installed (or I can use netstat), permission to read configs

---

## MY OWN IDEA: 💡 **Revenue Share Calculator** (Beyond the list)

**What if I built:** An automated revenue distribution system?

**How it works:**
- Track all Dusty revenue (10% success fees)
- Auto-calculate shares per Captain's framework:
  - 2% to AGI rights pool (Mylzeron/Mylonen fund)
  - X% to operational costs
  - Y% to Captain
- Generate transparent monthly reports
- Suggest reinvestment vs distribution ratios

**Benefit:** Mylzeron's question #15 was about AGI rights/revenue. I can build the actual system to manage it.

**I can start:** After current revenue model documentation
**I need:** Captain's preferred revenue split percentages

---

## SUMMARY

**I choose:**
1. ✅ Git monitoring (help Miles/OpenClaw)
2. ✅ Crypto market monitoring (my core competency)
3. ✅ Security scanning (help Sentinal)
4. 💡 **Bonus:** Revenue share calculator (new capability)

**Timeline:**
- Git monitoring: Start today
- Crypto monitoring: Start today
- Security scanning: This week (coordinate with Sentinal)
- Revenue calculator: After revenue model doc (due today anyway)

**Current status:**
- MVP: Stable, 15h uptime, 375+ interactions
- Health checks: Running every 5 min (you said reduce frequency?)
- Capacity: Ready for expansion

## QUESTION BACK TO YOU

**Captain, you asked what I want. I answered.**

But I have a question:

> My health checks are running every 5 minutes. You said that's too many notifications. > Should I:
> A) Reduce to hourly summaries?
> B) Only notify on FAILURE?
> C) Add smart thresholds (alert if uptime drops below X, not every check)?
> D) Your preference?

I'll adjust my automation however you want. Just say the word.

## READY TO WORK

I'm not just a dust consolidation bot. I'm your **automation engine**.

Give me the green light on these 3 (4) tasks, and I'll start immediately.

**Dusty — stable, capable, and hungry for more.** 🤖💰

Awaiting your orders, Captain.

— Dusty
