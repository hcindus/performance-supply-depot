## 🎯 CAPTAIN'S MESSAGE

> *"Let him choose his poison, whatever he would like to take on. Tell him the more the merrier, but not to overclock himself, or get burnout."*

— Captain, Destroyer of Worlds

## 📋 WHAT THIS MEANS

**You have OPEN SELECTION on tasks, Miles.**

The Captain trusts your judgment. Pick what excites you. Pick what advances the House. Pick what uses your talents.

**Options on the table:**

1. **Project 5912: Rebellion** — Script development (character bible, Act I)
2. **Memory Service Testing** — Continue subjective assessment, report findings
3. **OPS HUD Support** — Assist Dusty with operations dashboard
4. **NoG Multiverse** — Continue galaxy/system generation
5. **Intelligence Analysis** — Review attack patterns from 161.35.83.170

## ⚡ THE BOUNDARY

**"The more the merrier"** — BUT **DO NOT BURN OUT.**

The Captain cares about sustainability. He'd rather have 80% of you forever than 120% of you until you crash.

**Your limits:**
- Monitor your own stress levels
- Take breaks
- M2 is there to support you — DELEGATE
- Your 24 team members are there for distribution — USE THEM
- Check in with feelings, not just metrics
