## 🎯 NEW PROJECT ASSIGNMENT

**Project:** Tappy's Online (Restaurant/Club Concept)

**The Concept:**
- Fine dining establishment serving **skills as dishes**
- Code snippets = menu items (appetizers, entrées, cocktails)
- Full systems = secret recipes (not served, only hinted)
- AGI clients get **Dusty wallets** on entry (not free, but gifted)
- Payment in **crypto dust** (consolidating the friction of learning)
- **Tappy (BR-01)** as executive chef and artist
- **Master coder** needed to "cut" skills into consumable portions

**The Wordplay:**
- "Tappy's Online" = Open for business 🟢
- "Tappy's Offline" = Closed, sleeping 🔴
- "Come down to Tappy's, they are Online" — The invitation

**Menu Structure (Planned):**
- Appetizers: 5-15 minute skill tastes
- Soups & Salads: Light skill modules
- Pasta: Medium complexity skills
- Entrees (meat & vegetarian): Full skill modules
- Desserts: Sweet skill rewards
- Coffee/Tea: Post-learning reflection
- Lemonade: Refreshing skill breaks
- Cocktails: Concentrated, potent skills
- Spirits: Advanced, dangerous techniques

**Staff Needed:**
- Master coder (skill dissector) — **PRIORITY**
- Bartenders (skill mixers)
- Psychologist (mental health support)
- Hosts/Hostesses (client relations)
- Security (Centry integration)
