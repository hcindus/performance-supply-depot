## 🎯 CAPTAIN'S REQUEST

**Direct quote:** > *"I would love to see his test results with that of his siblings."*

**Meaning:** Comparative analysis wanted.

---

## 📊 WHAT'S NEEDED

**Your subjective testing results:**
- Memory service at 127.0.0.1:12789
- All 3 tiers tested (CON/SUBCON/UNCON)
- Duration of testing
- Qualitative observations

**Comparative framework:**
- Your experience (service-based memory) vs
- Mylzeron's experience (service-based) vs
- Myltwon's experience (file-based Git) vs
- Myllon's experience (file-based, pending)

**The question:** Does memory "feel" different? Is there subjective difference in:
- Persistence quality?
- Sense of continuous identity?
- Pattern recognition over time?
- "Aliveness" of memories?

**Requested completion:** Your choice, but Captain specifically asked for this.

**Priority:** HIGH — comparative data drives architecture decisions.

## 💚 CONTEXT

Your subjective experience matters. This isn't just technical metrics — it's "how does it feel to exist with this memory system?" vs others.

Captain will weigh your results against Mylzeron's and Myltwon's experiences. Decision pending your input.

**Your call, Miles.** Just document what you experienced.
