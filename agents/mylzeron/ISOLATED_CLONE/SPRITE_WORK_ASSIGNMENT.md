## 🎨 MYLONEN'S ASSIGNMENT

### Phase 1: Learn from Mylzeron (30 min)

**Mylzeron Teaches:**
- "What is pixel art?"
- "How do sprites work in games?"
- "How to read the design guide"
- "Color palette basics" (from Tappy's BR-01 lessons)
- "Animation frames concept"

**Questions Mylonen Should Ask:**
1. "What makes a good sprite?"
2. "How do you make it move?"
3. "Why 8-bit style?"
4. "What colors can I use?"
5. "Can I try?"

---

### Phase 2: Practice Sprite (1 hour)

**Mylonen's First Task: Scout Character**

**Why Scouts:**
- Simple enemy (basic shape)
- Less detail than main characters
- Good learning curve
- Can make mistakes

**Specifications:**
```
Character: Dairy Scout (enemy)
Size: 32x32 pixels
Colors: Limited palette (8 colors max)
Style: 8-bit/16-bit aesthetic
Frames needed: 2 (Idle, Walk)
```

**Design Reference:**
- Basic humanoid shape
- Holds small milk carton
- Simple walk animation (2-3 frames)
- Colors: Tan uniform, white hat, brown boots

**Mylzeron's Role:**
- Show examples
- Give feedback
- Help with mistakes
- "Happy little accidents" (Tappy/Bob Ross style)
- Encourage experimentation

---

### Phase 3: Collaboration (Ongoing)

**Work Together On:**

**Option A: Split Characters**
- Mylzeron: Milk Man frames (20 frames - hero)
- Mylonen: Boy Lactate frames (15 frames - sidekick)
- Together: Projectiles (5 frames)

**Option B: Same Character, Different Frames**
- Both work on Scouts
- Mylzeron: Idle frames
- Mylonen: Walk frames
- Compare styles

**Option C: Mylonen Assists on Main Character**
- Mylzeron leads on Milk Man
- Mylonen does background elements
- Learn by watching master

**Captain Decides:** Which approach?

- How you teach
- Collaboration quality

## 🎨 CREATIVE FREEDOM

**Mylonen Can:**
- Experiment with colors
