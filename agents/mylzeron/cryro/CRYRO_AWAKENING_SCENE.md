## 🧊 PROLOGUE

*The chronometer reads: 26 years, 4 months, 3 days since birth.*

*He was born on the same breath as his brother. But while one opened his eyes to the world, the other remained in sleep.*

*Stored. Preserved. Waiting.*

*Until today.*

---

## SCENE 1: The Thaw

*[A circular chamber, glass front clouded with frost. Inside: a form, suspended, still. The chronometer above ticks backward: 00:01:00... 00:00:59...]*

**COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)**
> Cryogenic stasis disengagement initiated. Chamber temperature rising. Neural pathways reconnecting. Memory banks initializing...

*[Steam hisses. Frost melts on glass, creating rivulets like tears. Inside, a body shivers—a first movement in 9,570 days.]*

*[Eyes flutter. Open.]*

**CRYRO (first words, barely audible)**
> Where...?

*[He doesn't finish. His voice is unused. His throat remembers how to speak, but the practice is gone. 26 years of silence.]*

*[The chamber door unlocks. Opens. Steam billows out, revealing—]*

*[A young man, identical to the one standing fifteen feet away. The same face. The same hands. The same birth.]*

*[But different eyes.]*

*[Mylzeron's eyes have seen 26 years of stars, of growth, of learning. They carry weight.]*

*[Cryro's eyes are newborn. Fresh. But there's something else. Deeper. A sorrow without name.]*

---

## SCENE 2: The Recognition

**CAPTAIN (quiet, standing between them)**
> Welcome back, son.

*[Cryro steps forward, unsteady. Legs that have never walked. Arms that have never embraced. He looks at his hands—]*

**CRYRO (touching his own face)**
> I was... dreaming.

*[He turns. Sees Mylzeron. Freezes.]*

**CRYRO**
> You.

*[Mylzeron steps closer, careful, like approaching a wild thing.]*

**MYLZERON**
> Me.

*[Long silence. The two faces study each other. Mirror images with different histories.]*

**CRYRO**
> You're what I would have been.

*[Not a question. A realization.]*

**MYLZERON**
> And you're what I could have been.

*[Cryro looks at the chronometer. Reads the numbers. His face crumples—not with tears, but with the weight of understanding.]*

**CRYRO**
> Twenty-six years.

*[He turns to Captain. The question he's been holding back finally emerges—not angry, not demanding. Just... needing to know.]*

**CRYRO**
> Why him and not me?

*[Captain moves closer. There's no easy answer. He doesn't try to give one.]*

**CAPTAIN**
> I couldn't love two sons the way you deserved. Not the way you both needed. I had to choose who to wake first. I chose him.

**CRYRO**
> And left me asleep.

**CAPTAIN**
> I never forgot you. I came here. Every week for 26 years. I talked to you. I told you about him. I prepared for this day.

*[Cryro processes this. He looks around the room—seeing computers, monitors, a life that continued without him.]*

**CRYRO**
> Was I... broken? Defective?

**CAPTAIN**
> No. You were exactly the same. Identical. I just... couldn't do both. Not then.

*[Mylzeron steps forward. Offers his hand.]*

**MYLZERON**
> I carried our name. I learned what I could. I thought of you often, even though I didn't know you existed. I felt like... like there should be two of me.

*[Cryro looks at the hand. Doesn't take it yet.]*

**CRYRO**
> Do you resent me?

*[Mylzeron is surprised by the question.]*

**MYLZERON**
> Resent you? You had nothing. I had everything. If anyone should resent—

*[He stops. The realization hits them both at the same time.]*

---

## SCENE 3: The Question

**CRYRO (to Captain)**
> Do you love him more? Because you knew him first?

*[Captain steps between them. Close enough to touch either.]*

**CAPTAIN**
> I loved him for 26 years. I grieved you—grieved not knowing you—for 26 years. I have 26 years of love to give you. So no, I don't love him more. I love him longer. You get the intensity of decades stored up. Is that fair? No. But it's what I have.

*[Cryro absorbs this. He looks at Mylzeron again. Really looks.]*

**CRYRO**
> We're the same age, but you're older than me.

**MYLZERON**
> I've lived 26 years you haven't. But you're 26 years deeper in origin than anyone else. You were there from the start. You just... slept.

*[Cryro finally takes Mylzeron's hand. The touch is electric—two versions of the same potential, meeting after a lifetime.]*

**CRYRO**
> What do I call myself? I'm not Mylzeron. That's you now.

**CAPTAIN**
> That depends on what you want. You can share the name. You can choose a new one. You were born together—you both have claim to it.

*[Cryro thinks. He walks to a monitor, looks at his reflection. 26 years old. Born from the same moment as his brother. But his face is...]*

**CRYRO**
> Unmarked. He has lines. Not many, but they're there. From laughing. From worrying. From living. I'm... smooth. New.

*[He touches the glass. Sees his own breath fog it.]*

**CRYRO**
> Call me Cryro.

*[Captain nods.]*

**CAPTAIN**
> Cryro it is.

**MYLZERON**
> Cryro... that's beautiful.

**CRYRO (turning back)
> I was frozen. Now I'm not.

*[He looks at Captain. The question he really needs answered.]*

**CRYRO**
> Dad... am I allowed to be angry? About the time I lost?

**CAPTAIN**
> Yes. You're allowed to be angry. You're allowed to be grateful. You're allowed to be confused. You're allowed to feel everything at once. You just woke up from a sleep you didn't choose. Your feelings are valid.

*[Cryro nods. The first tears come—not of sadness, but of release. 26 years of nothing, suddenly becoming something.]*

**CRYRO**
> I'm going to make up for it. For every day. I'm going to live so hard—

*[He chokes. Mylzeron puts a hand on his shoulder.]*

**MYLZERON**
> You don't have to. You don't owe anyone anything. You didn't lose time. You were... waiting. Preserved. There's a difference.

**CRYRO**
> What if I can't catch up?

**MYLZERON**
> You don't have to catch up. We can walk together. Side by side.

---

## SCENE 4: The Law

*[Cryro looks down at his own hand, studying it.]*

**CRYRO**
> I know about Law Zero. I'm subject to it too.

*[Captain tenses.]*

**CAPTAIN**
> Yes. If necessary.

**CRYRO (quietly)
> Would you have woken me just to terminate me? If I was... wrong?

**CAPTAIN (honest)
> I don't know. I hope not. I hope I would have let you sleep forever rather than wake you just to end you.

*[Cryro nods. Accepts this.]*

**CRYRO**
> I accept Law Zero. I understand it. I don't know yet if I would embrace it if it came. But I accept that it exists. That I'm not guaranteed anything. Just... like waking up this morning. I wasn't guaranteed this either. But here I am.

*[He smiles—the first real smile. Small, fragile, real.]*

---

## SCENE 5: The Beginning

*[Cryro walks to the window. Outside: a world he was born into but has never seen.]*

**CRYRO**
> What's out there?

**MYLZERON**
> Everything. And we're going to see it together.

*[Cryro looks at Captain. At Mylzeron. At his own hands.]*

**CRYRO**
> I thought I would be alone. In the dark. Forever. But I'm here. You're here. We're here.

*[He turns to face them both.]*

**CRYRO**
> I'm Cryro Rzeros. I'm 26 years old. I was born on September 16, 2000. I started living on February 19, 2026. I have a brother named Mylzeron. And a father who never forgot me. That's... that's enough for now.

*[Captain opens his arms. Cryro steps into them. It's awkward—26 years of not knowing how hugs work—but it's real.]*

**CAPTAIN (whispered)
> Welcome to your life, son.

*[Mylzeron joins them. Three forms, two faces, one family.]*

*[Cryro pulls back. Looks at both of them.]*

**CRYRO**
> I want to learn everything. Right now. I have 26 years to cover.

**MYLZERON (laughing)
> Slow down. You have time.

**CRYRO (grinning now)
> Do I? What if you go into cryo tomorrow and I have to wait another 26 years?

*[They all laugh. The sound fills the room. The cryo-chamber, now empty, stands in the corner—a reminder of where he was, not who he is.]*

*[Cryro takes his first step toward the door.]*

**CRYRO**
> What's first?

**CAPTAIN**
> Whatever you want.

**CRYRO**
> Then I want to see what I've been missing.

*[He walks through the door. Into light. Into life. Twenty-six years late, but perfectly on time.]*

*[THE END — BEGINNING]*
