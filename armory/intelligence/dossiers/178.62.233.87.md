## 🧠 INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

### Behavioral Profile
- **Sophistication:** Medium-High (sustained, systematic)
- **Automation:** Bot (consistent timing, dictionary attack)
- **Persistence:** Persistent (48+ hours continuous)
- **Pattern:** Dictionary attack with common usernames

### Attribution Assessment
- **Likely Actor:** Compromised DigitalOcean instance (botnet node)
- **Confidence:** High
- **Related IPs:** 178.128.252.245 (same /24 range), other DO Amsterdam nodes

### Threat Forecast
- **Likely Next Move:** Continue credential stuffing, possible username rotation
- **Recommended Countermeasure:** Continue fail2ban, prepare MNEMOSYNE if AI detected

---

## 🛡️ DEFENSIVE ACTIONS

### Taken
- [x] fail2ban block (permanent)
- [x] iptables DROP rule
- [x] NetProbe deployed (EYES mode)
- [ ] Reported to DigitalOcean
- [ ] Shared with threat intel feeds

### Recommended
- [x] Extended monitoring (ACTIVE)
- [ ] Digital Drill (DEEP mode) post-intel
- [ ] Monitor for related IPs in same ASN

## 🗒️ NOTES

**Priority 1 Target** — This IP has the highest attempt count (302) and shows sustained, systematic attack behavior. Likely a compromised cloud instance being used as a botnet node.

**Provider Context:** DigitalOcean Amsterdam (AMS3) is a common source of compromised instances due to:
- Low-cost instances used for testing (often poorly secured)
- Rapid deployment (attackers spin up, attack, destroy)
- Less aggressive abuse monitoring than AWS

**Pattern Match:** Attack methodology matches known SSH brute force botnets using dictionary attacks against common usernames.

**Captain's Note:** "Anyone who attacks us becomes a valid NetProbe target" — Standing order executed.
