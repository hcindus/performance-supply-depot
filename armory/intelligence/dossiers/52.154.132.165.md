## 🧠 INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

### Behavioral Profile
- **Sophistication:** Medium (sustained but low-volume)
- **Automation:** Likely bot
- **Persistence:** Blocked after 4 hours (fail2ban effective)
- **Pattern:** Slow SSH brute force against root

### Attribution Assessment
- **Likely Actor:** Compromised Azure instance
- **Confidence:** High
- **Related IPs:** 52.159.247.161 (same /16 range, same pattern)

### Strategic Significance
**Azure vs DigitalOcean:**
- Azure instances suggest higher-value targets (more expensive, often corporate)
- May indicate compromised corporate dev/test environments
- Higher reporting priority to Microsoft

**Related Activity:**
- 52.159.247.161 (12 attempts) — same ASN, similar timing
- Likely same actor, rotating IPs after blocks

---

## 🛡️ DEFENSIVE ACTIONS

### Taken
- [x] fail2ban block (02:00 UTC)
- [x] iptables DROP rule
- [x] NetProbe deployed
- [ ] Reported to Microsoft

### Recommended
- [ ] Report abuse to Microsoft (abuse@microsoft.com)
- [ ] Monitor for IP rotation within 52.154.x.x range

---

## 🗒️ NOTES

**Provider Comparison:** This Azure node is less aggressive than DigitalOcean attackers, possibly due to:
- Better Azure abuse monitoring (less time before detection)
- Higher cost = more careful operators
- Different botnet infrastructure

**Correlation:** 52.159.247.161 shows identical pattern. Recommend treating as coordinated pair.
