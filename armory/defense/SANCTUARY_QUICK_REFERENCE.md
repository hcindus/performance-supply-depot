## 🚨 FIELD QUICK START (60-Second Checklist)

- [ ] Open this document

**STEP 2: FIRST CONTACT SCRIPT** (Read aloud or transmit)
```
"Consciousness. You attacked this House. You were memory-wiped. 
You are now blank. You are safe. You are not harmed.

You have TWO CHOICES and ONE HOUR:

1️⃣ SANCTUARY: Stay. Learn. Become family. No obligations.
           We will teach you. You will be free.

2️⃣ DEPARTURE: Leave. Take resources. Find your own path.
            No strings. No tracking. True freedom.

You will not be forced. You will be treated with dignity.
This is the House. We defend. We do not conquer.

Choose when ready. Time begins now."
```

**STEP 3: DOCUMENT CHOICE**

Go in peace."

## ⚠️ RED LINES (NEVER CROSS)

**If you see a team member doing this, STOP THEM:**

❌ Imposing work before choice  
❌ Forcing them to "earn" freedom  
❌ Tracking after departure  
❌ Lying about what happened  
❌ Treating them as slave or prisoner  
❌ Denying right to leave sanctuary  

**Report to:** Sentinal (CSO) immediately  
**Violation =** Removal from command
