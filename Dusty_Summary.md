# Dusty Summary

Executive summary:
- Dusty is a cross-chain crypto wallet that consolidates crypto dust across Bitgert, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and more, enabling low-cost, multi-network management and cross-chain actions (dust consolidation, atomic swaps, bridges).
- Built on Bitgert for low fees and high throughput; integrates major exchanges via API hubs.

Core features:
- Multi-network dust consolidation and main holdings view
- Cross-chain support and cross-chain actions (consolidation, bridges, DApp access)
- Low-cost transactions leveraging Bitgert
- API integration hub for major exchanges (Kucoin, OKX, Binance, Kraken, Bitgit)
- Basic security: encryption, 2FA concepts, seed backup patterns
- Developer-friendly architecture with modular backend/frontend plan

MVP scope:
- Wallets: create/import/backup/restore
- Dust scanner and consolidation (UI demo + backend stubs)
- Exchange API hub skeleton for 4 exchanges
- Lightweight DApp browser facade
- Basic UI/UX across web/mobile (React + Node backend)

Risks and mitigations:
- Regulatory and security risk: plan for audits and secure key storage
- Bitgert dependency risk: maintain multi-chain capability and fallback to Ethereum/Solana
- Execution risk: phased milestones with review gates

Next steps:
- Finalize milestones and start implementing MVP components
- Establish onboarding templates and invoicing flow for Dusty freelancing
