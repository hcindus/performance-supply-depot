**Test Duration:** 71ms  
**Result:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

---

## Test Overview

This report documents the successful execution of the Dusty MVP end-to-end test, verifying the complete message flow from Telegram Bridge through Core-Agent to OpenClaw Mock.

## Test Results

### 1. Service Health Checks ✅

| Component | Status | Latency | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Telegram Bridge Mock (localhost:3001) | ✅ Healthy | 19.44ms | Uptime: 760m |
| Core-Agent (localhost:3000) | ✅ Healthy | 3.26ms | Uptime: 762m |
| OpenClaw Mock (localhost:4000) | ✅ Healthy | 4.07ms | 321 interactions |

All three services are running and responding to health checks within acceptable latency thresholds (<100ms).

### 2. End-to-End Flow Test ✅

**Test Scenario:** Send "/dust balance" command through complete pipeline

**Execution Steps:**
1. ✅ Bridge receives webhook (HTTP 200)
2. ✅ Core-Agent processes message (forwarded successfully)
3. ✅ OpenClaw responds with dust balance data

**Performance:**
- Total Round-Trip Time: 19.17ms
- Response includes balance report with ETH, USDC, and DUST token values

**Sample Response Preview:**
```
📊 **Your Current Balances**

• ETH: 0.5234 ETH (~$1,247.50)
• USDC: 150.00 USDC
• DUST tokens: 2,847.32 DUST (~$12.45)
...
```

### 3. Dust-Specific Functionality ✅

**Test Query:** "consolidate my dust tokens"

**Results:**
- ✅ Response received from OpenClaw
- ✅ Content is dust-related (contains "dust", "consolidate", or "token")
- ✅ Bot correctly identified as "dusty"
- ✅ Action type correctly identified

## Architecture Verification

```
[Telegram Bridge Mock] → [Core-Agent] → [OpenClaw Mock]
       Port 3001            Port 3000       Port 4000
            ↓                    ↓                ↓

```

All communication links verified operational.

## Conclusion

The Dusty MVP infrastructure is **fully operational**. All components are healthy, the end-to-end message flow is functioning correctly, and dust-specific queries are being processed and responded to appropriately.

**Status:** PRODUCTION READY for MVP testing
